You have processed multiple commits. Review the documentation progress and identify patterns.

New concepts identified in recent commits:
{{concepts}}

Pages created/updated:
{{pageList}}

Tasks:
1. Identify overarching themes or architecture patterns emerging
2. Suggest new high-level documentation pages that would be useful
3. Flag any inconsistencies or gaps in documentation
4. Recommend page reorganization if needed (e.g., split large topics, merge related topics)

Return JSON only with the following structure:
{
  "themes": [
    "array of identified patterns or architectural themes"
  ],
  "newPagesNeeded": [
    {
      "title": "suggested page title",
      "reason": "why this page would be useful",
      "category": "concepts|components|guides"
    }
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "array of missing documentation or unclear areas"
  ],
  "reorganization": [
    {
      "action": "split|merge|rename",
      "target": "page name or names",
      "reason": "why this would improve documentation"
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Look for patterns across multiple commits
- Suggest documentation that would help developers understand the system
- Be selective - only suggest high-value additions
- Consider what questions a new developer would ask
- Prioritize clarity and usefulness over completeness

DO NOT output anything other than valid JSON.
