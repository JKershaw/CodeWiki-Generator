# Wiki Research Results Structure

The wiki research results structure defines the comprehensive data format returned by WikiContextService operations. This structure provides developers with organized, actionable information about wiki content including summaries, relevant pages, implementation guidance, and metadata for effective project understanding.

## Key Functionality

The results structure contains several key components:

- **Summary**: High-level overview of the researched topic
- **Relevant Pages**: List of wiki pages related to the query with contextual information
- **Key Components**: Important code components and modules identified during research
- **Key Concepts**: Abstract concepts and patterns discovered in the wiki content
- **Implementation Guidance**: Practical advice for implementing or using the researched functionality
- **Related Files**: File paths and locations relevant to the topic
- **Metadata**: Request statistics including token usage, costs, and API call tracking

The service also provides API usage tracking capabilities, monitoring token consumption and calculating costs for AI API interactions to help developers manage resource usage.

## Relationships

This structure is:
- Generated by the WikiContextService class from `../lib/wiki-context-service`
- Used in both CLI and web application integration patterns
- Designed to work with project-based wiki organization under configurable base paths
- Compatible with Express.js REST API endpoints for web service integration

## Usage Example

```javascript
const WikiContextService = require('../lib/wiki-context-service');

// Initialize service with wiki base path
const wikiService = new WikiContextService({ wikiBasePath: './docs/wiki' });

// Research a topic and get structured results
const results = await wikiService.research('authentication system');

// Access different components of the results
console.log('Summary:', results.summary);
console.log('Key Components:', results.keyComponents);
console.log('Implementation Guidance:', results.implementationGuidance);
console.log('API Stats:', results.metadata);
```

For web application integration:

```javascript
app.get('/api/research/:topic', async (req, res) => {
  const results = await wikiService.research(req.params.topic);
  res.json(results);
});
```
