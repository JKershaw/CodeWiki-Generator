# Context Research System Integration

## Purpose and Overview

The Context research system integration validates WikiResearcher functionality for gathering multi-context information across different layers of the wiki system. It ensures intelligent document contextualization by testing the researcher's ability to collect high-level, code, guides, historical, and quality context information.

## Key Functionality

The context research system integration provides:

- **Multi-context information gathering** - Collects context from high-level overviews, code documentation, guides, historical records, and quality assessments
- **WikiResearcher validation** - Verifies that the WikiResearcher component functions correctly across all context types
- **Intelligent contextualization** - Supports smart document organization and cross-referencing by understanding relationships between different information layers
- **Context verification** - Ensures gathered context is accurate and complete for each information type

The system works by testing the WikiResearcher's ability to traverse and extract meaningful information from multiple wiki layers, validating that context gathering works seamlessly across the entire documentation ecosystem.

## Relationships

This component is part of the larger **Multi-layer wiki verification framework** and works closely with:

- **Wiki expansion validation testing** - Uses the verification methodology to ensure context research completeness
- **WikiResearcher component** - The core component being tested and validated
- **Multi-layer wiki system** - Operates across meta/history/quality layers to gather comprehensive context
- **Directory structure validation** - Ensures context can be properly gathered from organized wiki hierarchies

## Usage Example

No usage examples available - see source code for implementation details. The component is primarily used within the verification framework at `verify-wiki-expansion.js` for testing WikiResearcher functionality.

## Testing

This component is part of the comprehensive verification suite that includes 8 key test categories:
- Directory structure validation
- Meta documents verification
- History documents checking
- Cross-layer relationship testing
- Researcher functionality validation
- Index updates verification
- Slash commands testing
- Page count validation

No automated unit tests were found specifically for this component - testing appears to be handled through the broader wiki expansion validation framework.
