# Processor-based Page Operations

## Purpose and Overview

Processor-based page operations provide a standardized interface for performing batch transformations across entire wiki collections. This component demonstrates the Processor class pattern through the `addCrossLinksToAllPages` method, enabling systematic modification of all pages in a wiki.

## Key Functionality

The component establishes a pattern for applying operations to all pages in a wiki through the Processor class interface:

- **Batch Processing**: The `addCrossLinksToAllPages` method processes every page in the wiki collection
- **Transformation Pipeline**: Applies consistent modifications across the entire wiki structure
- **Extensible Pattern**: Provides a template for implementing other wiki-wide operations

The processor handles the iteration logic and page management, allowing operations to focus on the specific transformation logic rather than collection handling.

## Relationships

This component works closely with:

- **Processor Class**: Implements the core batch processing interface and page iteration logic
- **Standalone Cross-linking Utility**: Serves as the primary example implementation in `add-cross-links.js`
- **Wiki Pages**: Operates on the collection of pages managed by the wiki system
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Integrates with standardized CLI error handling for robust operation

## Usage Example

```javascript
const Processor = require('./processor');

// Initialize processor with wiki data
const processor = new Processor(wikiConfig);

// Apply cross-linking to all pages
processor.addCrossLinksToAllPages();
```

## Testing

No automated tests found for this component. Testing would benefit from coverage of the batch processing interface and transformation patterns.
