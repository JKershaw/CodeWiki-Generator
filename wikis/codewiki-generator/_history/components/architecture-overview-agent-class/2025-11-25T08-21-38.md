# ArchitectureOverviewAgent class

## Purpose and Overview

The ArchitectureOverviewAgent class is a specialized documentation synthesis agent that generates comprehensive architecture.md files by aggregating and processing multi-type wiki data. It leverages Claude API integration with structured prompt templates to transform fragmented documentation across concepts, components, and guides into coherent system-level architecture documentation.

## Key Functionality

The agent implements several core capabilities:

- **Multi-category wiki aggregation**: Consolidates heterogeneous wiki data types (concepts, components, guides) into a unified prompt context for LLM processing
- **Claude API orchestration**: Manages API calls with structured prompt templates to generate architecture-focused documentation
- **Markdown output sanitization**: Processes LLM responses by stripping code blocks and frontmatter to ensure clean, consistent documentation artifacts
- **Agent-based documentation synthesis**: Demonstrates the agent architecture pattern for automated documentation generation tasks

The workflow involves collecting various wiki data sources, formatting them into a structured prompt, sending the consolidated context to Claude, and post-processing the response to produce clean markdown output.

## Relationships

This component integrates with several system elements:

- **Claude API service**: Utilizes LLM capabilities for intelligent documentation synthesis
- **Wiki data sources**: Consumes structured data from concepts, components, and guides collections
- **Prompt template system**: Uses formatting logic to structure input data for optimal LLM processing
- **Documentation pipeline**: Serves as a specialized agent within the broader documentation generation architecture

## Usage Example

```javascript
const ArchitectureOverviewAgent = require('./lib/agents/architecture-overview-agent');

const agent = new ArchitectureOverviewAgent();
const wikiData = {
  concepts: [...],
  components: [...],
  guides: [...]
};

const architectureDocs = await agent.generateOverview(wikiData);
```
