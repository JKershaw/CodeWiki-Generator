# Documentation Writer Agent

## Purpose and Overview

The Documentation Writer Agent is a specialized component that generates wiki documentation from code analysis using the Claude API. It implements documentation generation as a discrete agent within the multi-agent system, enabling automated creation of structured markdown documentation from analyzed codebase concepts.

## Key Functionality

The agent processes code analysis results and transforms them into structured wiki documentation through:

- **Automated Documentation Generation**: Converts code analysis concepts into markdown documentation using Claude's language model
- **Markdown Response Sanitization**: Implements utility patterns to clean Claude's output by removing extraneous code block wrappers and ensuring consistent documentation format
- **Structured Content Creation**: Generates documentation with standardized sections including purpose, functionality, relationships, and usage examples

The agent leverages the Claude API to understand code concepts and produce human-readable documentation that explains component purposes, behaviors, and integration patterns.

## Relationships

The Documentation Writer Agent integrates with several core system components:

- **ClaudeClient**: Uses the common Claude API interface for language model interactions
- **PromptManager**: Leverages shared prompt management for consistent documentation generation instructions
- **Multi-Agent System**: Operates as a specialized agent alongside other agents like code analyzers, implementing the agent-based documentation pipeline pattern
- **Code Analysis Pipeline**: Consumes structured code analysis results as input for documentation generation

This architecture enables modular and composable documentation workflows where different agents handle distinct responsibilities through common interfaces.

## Usage Example

```javascript
const DocumentationWriterAgent = require('./lib/agents/documentation-writer-agent');

const agent = new DocumentationWriterAgent(claudeClient, promptManager);
const documentation = await agent.generateDocumentation(codeAnalysisResults);
console.log(documentation); // Sanitized markdown output
```
