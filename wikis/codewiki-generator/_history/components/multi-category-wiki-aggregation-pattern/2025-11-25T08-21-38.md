# Multi-category Wiki Aggregation Pattern

## Purpose and Overview

The multi-category wiki aggregation pattern consolidates heterogeneous wiki data types (concepts, components, guides) into a unified prompt context for documentation synthesis. This pattern enables the systematic aggregation of knowledge across multiple domains into coherent, system-level documentation through structured data formatting.

## Key Functionality

The pattern implements several core capabilities:

- **Data Consolidation**: Aggregates wiki entries from different categories (concepts, components, guides) into a structured format suitable for LLM processing
- **Unified Context Generation**: Transforms disparate documentation types into a consistent prompt template that maintains categorical distinctions while enabling cross-domain synthesis
- **Format Standardization**: Establishes consistent formatting logic that handles varying data structures across different wiki categories
- **Contextual Preservation**: Maintains the semantic relationships between different documentation types during the aggregation process

The pattern works by collecting wiki data from multiple sources, applying category-specific formatting rules, and combining them into a comprehensive context that preserves both individual item details and inter-category relationships.

## Relationships

This pattern serves as a foundational component for:

- **ArchitectureOverviewAgent class**: Utilizes this pattern to prepare comprehensive wiki data for architecture documentation generation
- **Agent-based documentation synthesis**: Provides the data preparation layer that enables agents to work with multi-domain knowledge
- **Markdown output sanitization**: Works in conjunction with output cleaning to ensure consistent final documentation artifacts

The pattern acts as a bridge between raw wiki data storage and LLM-based documentation generation systems.

## Usage Example

```javascript
const ArchitectureOverviewAgent = require('./lib/agents/architecture-overview-agent');

const agent = new ArchitectureOverviewAgent();
const wikiData = {
  concepts: [...],
  components: [...],
  guides: [...]
};

const result = agent.generateArchitectureDoc(wikiData);
```

## Testing

No automated tests found for this pattern. Testing coverage should be implemented to verify data aggregation accuracy across different wiki categories and ensure proper formatting consistency.
