# Cross-page Link Discovery System

## Purpose and Overview

The cross-page link discovery system automatically detects mentions of wiki pages within content and generates intelligent cross-page hyperlinks. It uses pattern-based detection with markup awareness to identify semantic relationships between pages and suggest related content connections.

## Key Functionality

- **Intelligent Mention Detection**: Scans content for wiki page references using pattern matching that respects markdown formatting
- **Markup Awareness**: Avoids false positives by ignoring mentions within bold text, existing links, and code blocks
- **Priority-based Ranking**: Prioritizes mentions found in bold formatting over plain text references
- **Deduplication**: Ensures unique page references by removing duplicate mentions from results
- **Relationship Mapping**: Builds connections between pages based on discovered mentions for related page suggestions

The system processes unstructured markdown content and extracts semantic relationships, forming the foundation for automated cross-page navigation and content discovery features.

## Relationships

- **Agent Architecture**: Implements the `LinkDiscoveryAgent` as part of a broader agent-based system for delegated content analysis tasks
- **Content Processing Pipeline**: Integrates with markdown processing workflows to enhance content with automatic linking
- **Wiki Navigation**: Supports wiki navigation systems by providing discovered page relationships and suggestions
- **Cross-reference Systems**: Feeds into systems that generate "See Also" sections and related page recommendations

## Usage Example

```javascript
const LinkDiscoveryAgent = require('./lib/agents/link-discovery-agent');

const agent = new LinkDiscoveryAgent();
const content = "This page relates to **User Management** and Login Systems.";
const discoveredLinks = agent.discoverLinks(content);
```

## Testing

No automated tests are currently available for this component. Manual testing and integration verification are recommended when implementing or modifying the link discovery functionality.
