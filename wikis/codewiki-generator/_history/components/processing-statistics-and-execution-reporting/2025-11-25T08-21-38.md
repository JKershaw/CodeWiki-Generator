# Processing Statistics and Execution Reporting

## Purpose and Overview

This component provides structured output summarizing documentation generation results for the self-wiki system. It tracks and reports key metrics including commits processed, files handled, pages created, and cost tracking to provide operational transparency during automated wiki generation.

## Key Functionality

The processing statistics and execution reporting component:

- **Tracks Processing Metrics**: Monitors the number of git commits processed, files analyzed, and wiki pages generated during execution
- **Reports Cost Information**: Provides cost tracking capabilities to monitor expenses associated with documentation generation, particularly useful when switching between local and external API processing
- **Provides Execution Summary**: Generates comprehensive reports that give users visibility into the scope and results of wiki generation operations
- **Enables Operational Monitoring**: Offers structured data output that can be used for debugging, optimization, and process improvement

The component integrates with the git history analysis workflow to capture metrics at each stage of processing and presents them in a standardized format.

## Relationships

This component connects to several other parts of the self-documentation system:

- **Local git commit extraction**: Receives data about the number of commits and files processed from the git history analysis
- **Cost-controlled local processing**: Works with the mock client injection pattern to track cost savings when using local processing instead of external APIs  
- **Self-documentation system**: Serves as the reporting layer that provides feedback to users about the overall wiki generation process
- **Wiki generation workflow**: Acts as the final output stage that summarizes the entire documentation creation pipeline
