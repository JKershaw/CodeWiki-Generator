# Cross-page linking system

## Purpose and Overview

The cross-page linking system is a post-generation component that automatically injects hyperlinks between wiki pages and enriches page metadata with related page information. It establishes a multi-pass documentation generation pattern where content enhancement occurs after initial page creation, creating interconnected documentation networks.

## Key Functionality

The system operates through a coordinated multi-agent workflow that processes generated documentation in two phases:

- **Link Injection**: Uses DocumentationWriterAgent to analyze page content and inject relevant hyperlinks to related pages within the wiki
- **Relationship Discovery**: Leverages LinkDiscoveryAgent to identify semantic relationships between pages and build metadata about page connections
- **Conditional Updates**: Implements efficient page updating that only writes changes when content modifications occur, while simultaneously enriching frontmatter with computed metadata
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Updates page frontmatter with related pages information and global metadata tracking

The processor coordinates these agents in a unified pipeline, ensuring that documentation pages are both internally linked and properly cross-referenced through metadata.

## Relationships

The cross-page linking system integrates with several core components:

- **WikiManager**: Retrieves existing pages, searches for related content, and handles page updates with new links and metadata
- **DocumentationWriterAgent**: Performs the actual link injection into page content
- **LinkDiscoveryAgent**: Discovers semantic relationships between pages for metadata enrichment  
- **StateManager**: Tracks processing state to enable efficient incremental linking updates
- **Repository Processing Pipeline**: Operates as a post-processing step after initial page generation

## Usage Example

```javascript
const Processor = require('./lib/processor');

// Initialize processor with required dependencies
const processor = new Processor({
  wikiManager: wikiManager,
  stateManager: stateManager,
  codeAnalysisAgent: codeAnalysisAgent,
  docWriterAgent: docWriterAgent,
  linkDiscoveryAgent: linkDiscoveryAgent
});

// Process repository to generate and cross-link documentation
await processor.processRepository(repositoryPath);
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage**: tests/unit/processor.test.js
- 26 test cases across 6 test suites
- Test categories include: Processor, processCommit, isSignificantFile, getRelevantContext, determinePagePath, processRepository
- Comprehensive mocking of WikiManager, StateManager, and agent dependencies for isolated testing
