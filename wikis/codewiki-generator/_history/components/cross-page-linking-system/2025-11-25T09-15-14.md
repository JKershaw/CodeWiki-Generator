# Cross-page linking system

## Purpose and Overview

The cross-page linking system is a post-generation component that automatically discovers page references in documentation content and converts them to hyperlinks while preserving formatting and avoiding self-references. It establishes a multi-pass documentation generation pattern where content enhancement occurs after initial page creation, creating interconnected documentation networks.

## Key Functionality

The system operates through intelligent link injection and discovery mechanisms:

- **Automatic Link Discovery**: Integrates LinkDiscoveryAgent to identify mentions of other pages within documentation content and convert them to proper markdown hyperlinks
- **Smart Formatting Preservation**: Maintains existing text formatting, particularly bold text handling, when injecting links into content
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents adding links to text already embedded in markdown link syntax by analyzing surrounding content context, avoiding malformed markdown when processing content with existing links
- **Self-Reference Prevention**: Avoids creating links from a page to itself during the link injection process
- **Content-Aware Processing**: Analyzes page content contextually to determine appropriate link placement without disrupting document structure

## Relationships

The cross-page linking system integrates with several core components:

- **LinkDiscoveryAgent**: Provides the core page reference identification and link creation functionality
- **DocumentationWriterAgent**: Implements the link injection logic as part of its content processing capabilities
- **WikiManager**: Retrieves existing pages for cross-referencing and handles page updates with newly injected links
- **Repository Processing Pipeline**: Operates as a post-processing step after initial documentation generation
- **Markdown Processing**: Works within markdown content structure to maintain proper formatting and syntax

## Usage Example

```javascript
const DocumentationWriterAgent = require('./lib/agents/documentation-writer-agent');

// The cross-page linking system operates as part of the DocumentationWriterAgent
const docAgent = new DocumentationWriterAgent(config);

// Link injection happens during content processing
// The agent automatically discovers page references and converts them to links
// while preserving formatting and preventing collision with existing links
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage**: No automated tests found for the cross-page linking system components. Testing would benefit from coverage of link discovery, collision detection, and formatting preservation scenarios.
