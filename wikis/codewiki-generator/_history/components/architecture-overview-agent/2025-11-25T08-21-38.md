# ArchitectureOverviewAgent

## Purpose and Overview

The ArchitectureOverviewAgent is a specialized component in the documentation generation pipeline that creates system-level architecture documentation by synthesizing categorized wiki pages. It generates comprehensive architectural overviews after code analysis is complete, providing high-level insights into the codebase structure and organization.

## Key Functionality

- **Architecture Synthesis**: Analyzes existing wiki pages categorized as concepts, components, and guides to generate unified architecture documentation
- **Two-phase Generation**: Operates in the second phase of documentation generation, after code analysis is complete, enabling higher-level synthesis without being blocked by cost limits  
- **Category-based Analysis**: Works with semantically grouped documentation (concepts, components, guides) to create meaningful architectural insights
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Implements graceful degradation patterns where architecture generation errors don't block other documentation processes
- **Agent Pattern Integration**: Follows the established agent pattern used by DocumentationWriterAgent, MetaAnalysisAgent, and other agents in the system

## Relationships

- **Processor Pipeline**: Integrated into the post-processing pipeline in `lib/processor.js`
- **Wiki Manager**: Interacts with the wiki system to access categorized pages and create architecture documentation
- **Peer Agents**: Works alongside DocumentationWriterAgent, MetaAnalysisAgent, TechDebtAgent, and SecurityAgent
- **State Management**: Coordinates with StateManager for processing state tracking
- **Category System**: Depends on the category-based documentation organization system for input data

## Usage Example

```javascript
const Processor = require('./lib/processor');

// Initialize processor with required dependencies
const processor = new Processor({
  wikiManager: mockWikiManager,
  stateManager: mockStateManager,
  codeAnalysisAgent: mockCodeAnalysisAgent,
  docWriterAgent: mockDocWriterAgent,
  architectureOverviewAgent: mockArchitectureOverviewAgent
});

// Architecture overview generation happens automatically in post-processing
await processor.processRepository(repositoryPath);
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage**: `tests/unit/processor.test.js`
- 26 test cases across 6 test suites
- Comprehensive testing of processor pipeline including architecture overview integration
- Test categories cover: Processor initialization, processCommit, isSignificantFile, getRelevantContext, determinePagePath, and processRepository workflows
- Validates graceful error handling and two-phase documentation generation patterns
