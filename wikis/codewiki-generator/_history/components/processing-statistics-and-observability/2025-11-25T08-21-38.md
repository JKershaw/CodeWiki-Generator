# Processing Statistics and Observability

## Purpose and Overview

The Processing statistics and observability component provides comprehensive tracking and visibility into CodeWiki Generator processing operations. It returns detailed statistics about commits, files, pages, meta-analysis runs, and API costs, enabling developers to monitor processing behavior and debug real-world test runs effectively.

## Key Functionality

The component tracks and reports multiple dimensions of processing activity:

- **Resource Processing**: Counts of commits processed, files analyzed, and pages generated
- **Meta-Analysis Tracking**: Number of meta-analysis operations performed during processing
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of API costs incurred during processing operations
- **Processing Visibility**: Comprehensive statistics that enable debugging and performance analysis
- **Budget Validation**: Support for cost-aware testing scenarios with predefined spending limits

The statistics are returned by the Processor after completing repository analysis, providing a complete picture of the processing session's resource usage and output generation.

## Relationships

This component integrates closely with:

- **Processor**: The primary source of statistics data, collecting metrics throughout the processing pipeline
- **Cost-aware testing**: Enables budget-constrained testing by providing real-time cost tracking
- **Self-referential processing**: Supports validation testing when the CodeWiki Generator processes its own repository
- **Repository analysis pipeline**: Provides observability into each stage of the processing workflow

## Usage Example

```javascript
const Processor = require('./processor');

const processor = new Processor();
const result = await processor.processRepository(repositoryPath, options);

// Access comprehensive processing statistics
console.log('Processing Statistics:', {
  commits: result.stats.commits,
  files: result.stats.files, 
  pages: result.stats.pages,
  metaAnalysisRuns: result.stats.metaAnalysisRuns,
  totalCost: result.stats.cost
});
```

## Testing

No automated tests found. The component is validated through the test-run.js script which performs real-world testing on the CodeWiki Generator's own repository with a $2.00 budget constraint to prevent unexpected API expenses during development.
