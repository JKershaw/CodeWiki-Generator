# Graceful Degradation in Documentation Generation

## Purpose and Overview

This guide outlines a pattern for implementing robust documentation generation systems that can recover from failures in optional processing steps. The pattern ensures that critical documentation phases complete successfully even when non-essential features encounter errors, providing resilient documentation pipelines that deliver partial results rather than complete failures.

## Key Functionality

The graceful degradation pattern works through several key mechanisms:

- **Error Isolation**: Wraps optional documentation generation steps (like architecture overview creation) in try-catch blocks to prevent failures from cascading
- **Continuation Logic**: Allows essential documentation processes (wiki index and guides generation) to proceed even when optional steps fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Captures and logs errors from failed optional steps while maintaining process flow
- **Partial Success Handling**: Distinguishes between critical failures that should halt processing and optional failures that can be logged and bypassed

The pattern typically applies to two-phase documentation systems where core content generation must complete before meta-documentation can be synthesized.

## Relationships

This pattern integrates with several architectural components:

- **Two-phase Documentation Generation Pipeline**: Provides the structural foundation where graceful degradation is most needed
- **ArchitectureOverviewAgent**: Often the optional component that benefits from graceful degradation, as architecture synthesis may fail due to complexity or resource limits
- **Category-based Documentation Organization**: Enables the system to continue generating organized documentation even when some categories fail to process
- **WikiManager and StateManager**: Core components that must remain functional for graceful degradation to provide value

## Usage Example

```javascript
const Processor = require('./lib/processor');

// Initialize processor with required managers and agents
const processor = new Processor({
  wikiManager: mockWikiManager,
  stateManager: mockStateManager,
  codeAnalysisAgent: mockCodeAnalysisAgent,
  docWriterAgent: mockDocWriterAgent,
  techDebtAgent: mockTechDebtAgent,
  securityAgent: mockSecurityAgent
});

// Process with graceful degradation - optional steps may fail
// but core documentation will still be generated
try {
  await processor.processRepository(repoPath);
  // Core documentation guaranteed, architecture overview optional
} catch (error) {
  // Only critical failures reach this level
  console.error('Critical documentation generation failed:', error);
}
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage**: `tests/unit/processor.test.js`
- 26 test cases across 6 test suites
- Tests cover: Processor initialization, processCommit, isSignificantFile, getRelevantContext, determinePagePath, and processRepository
- Comprehensive coverage ensures graceful degradation patterns work correctly under various failure scenarios
