# Cross-link Discovery and Validation Workflow

## Purpose and Overview

The cross-link discovery and validation workflow establishes a debugging and testing pattern for verifying that the cross-linking implementation works correctly across the wiki system. This workflow loads complete page content, discovers mentions between pages, and validates the entire linking pipeline end-to-end to ensure proper cross-referencing functionality.

## Key Functionality

The workflow performs several critical operations:

- **Full-page content loading** - Loads complete page content (not just metadata) to ensure accurate mention discovery and address content loading bugs
- **Cross-link discovery** - Identifies potential links and mentions between wiki pages by analyzing the full content
- **End-to-end validation** - Tests the complete linking pipeline from content analysis through link generation
- **Agent coordination** - Orchestrates multiple specialized agents to process wiki content in a coordinated manner

The workflow specifically addresses the requirement to load full page content rather than just metadata, which was identified as a critical bug fix for accurate mention discovery.

## Relationships

This workflow integrates with several key components:

- **Agent-based wiki processing pipeline** - Demonstrates collaboration between specialized agents (LinkDiscoveryAgent, DocumentationWriterAgent) and WikiManager
- **WikiManager** - Coordinates the overall wiki processing and content management
- **Content loading system** - Ensures complete page content is available for analysis
- **Cross-linking system** - Validates that the mention discovery and link generation processes work correctly

The workflow represents a modular agent-based architecture pattern where different specialized components work together to achieve comprehensive wiki cross-linking.

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Debug cross-links workflow execution
const wikiManager = new WikiManager();
const linkDiscoveryAgent = new LinkDiscoveryAgent();
const documentationAgent = new DocumentationWriterAgent();

// Load full page content and validate cross-links
await wikiManager.loadFullPageContent();
const crossLinks = await linkDiscoveryAgent.discoverMentions();
await documentationAgent.validateLinkingPipeline(crossLinks);
```

## Testing

No automated tests found for this workflow. Testing is currently performed through the debug script execution to validate cross-link discovery and generation functionality.
