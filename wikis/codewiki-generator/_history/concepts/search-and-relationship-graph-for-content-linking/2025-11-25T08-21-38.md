# Search and Relationship Graph for Content Linking

## Purpose and Overview

Provides keyword-based search functionality across wiki content and metadata with context snippets, plus a related pages system that connects pages through frontmatter metadata. This enables content discovery and cross-referencing patterns within the wiki structure.

## Key Functionality

The search and relationship system operates through two primary mechanisms:

- **Content Search**: Performs keyword-based searches across both page content and frontmatter metadata, returning results with contextual snippets to help users identify relevant pages
- **Related Pages**: Uses frontmatter metadata relationships to discover and suggest connected content, enabling users to navigate between related topics and build knowledge graphs

The system integrates with the hierarchical content discovery to search across nested directory structures while maintaining the organizational context of found results.

## Relationships

This concept builds on the **Wiki file management with frontmatter parsing** component to access parsed metadata and content for search operations. It works within the **Hierarchical content discovery and retrieval** system to search across the full wiki structure. The search functionality follows the **Graceful degradation for missing resources** pattern, returning empty arrays when no matches are found rather than throwing errors.

## Usage Example

```javascript
const WikiManager = require('./lib/wiki-manager');

const wikiManager = new WikiManager('./path/to/wiki');

// Search for pages containing specific keywords
const searchResults = await wikiManager.searchPages('keyword');

// Find pages related to a specific page through metadata
const relatedPages = await wikiManager.getRelatedPages('page-name.md');
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage**: tests/unit/wiki-manager.test.js
- 17 test cases across 5 test suites
- Includes dedicated test suites for `searchPages` and `getRelatedPages` functionality
- Tests cover search across content and metadata, as well as relationship discovery patterns
