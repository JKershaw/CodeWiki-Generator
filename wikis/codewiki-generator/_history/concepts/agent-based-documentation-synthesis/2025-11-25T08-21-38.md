# Architecture Overview Agent

## Purpose and Overview

The Architecture Overview Agent is a specialized agent implementation that synthesizes multi-type wiki data into coherent system-level documentation. It leverages LLM capabilities through Claude API integration to generate comprehensive architecture.md files from structured knowledge across concepts, components, and guides.

## Key Functionality

The `ArchitectureOverviewAgent` class orchestrates the following core operations:

- **Multi-category Data Aggregation**: Consolidates heterogeneous wiki data types (concepts, components, guides) into a unified prompt context for comprehensive system analysis
- **LLM-Powered Synthesis**: Integrates with Claude API using structured prompt templates to generate coherent architecture documentation
- **Markdown Output Processing**: Implements sanitization logic to clean LLM responses, stripping code blocks and frontmatter to ensure consistent documentation artifacts
- **Template-Driven Generation**: Uses prompt engineering to guide the LLM in producing structured, system-level architectural overviews

## Relationships

This component exemplifies the broader **agent-based documentation synthesis** pattern within the codebase architecture. It connects to:

- **Wiki Data Sources**: Consumes structured data from concept, component, and guide repositories
- **Claude API**: Integrates with external LLM services for intelligent content generation  
- **Markdown Processing Pipeline**: Outputs clean, formatted documentation ready for wiki integration
- **Agent Architecture Pattern**: Serves as a concrete implementation of the specialized agent approach for documentation tasks

## Usage Example

```javascript
const ArchitectureOverviewAgent = require('./lib/agents/architecture-overview-agent');

const agent = new ArchitectureOverviewAgent();
const wikiData = {
  concepts: [...],
  components: [...], 
  guides: [...]
};

const architectureDoc = agent.generateOverview(wikiData);
// Returns cleaned markdown content for architecture.md
```

## Testing

No automated tests found. This component would benefit from unit tests covering the multi-category aggregation logic, Claude API integration, and markdown sanitization functionality.
