# Agent-based Link Management

## Purpose and Overview

The agent-based link management system provides autonomous discovery and mapping of cross-page relationships within wiki content. It uses the LinkDiscoveryAgent to intelligently detect page mentions in markdown content and establish semantic connections between wiki pages for automatic hyperlinking and related page suggestions.

## Key Functionality

The system implements several core capabilities:

- **Intelligent Mention Detection**: Scans content for wiki page references using pattern-based recognition while avoiding false positives in markup elements (bold text, existing links, and code blocks)
- **Priority-based Ranking**: Distinguishes between different mention types, giving higher priority to bold text mentions over plain text references
- **Content Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate link suggestions by tracking and filtering previously identified mentions
- **Markup Awareness**: Understands markdown structure to avoid creating links within inappropriate contexts like code blocks or existing hyperlinks

The agent processes unstructured markdown content and extracts semantic relationships, transforming implicit page references into structured data for link generation.

## Relationships

This component integrates with the broader wiki system architecture:

- **Agent Architecture**: Functions as a specialized agent within an agent-based system, handling delegated content analysis tasks
- **Cross-page Link System**: Serves as the foundation component for automatic hyperlink generation between wiki pages
- **Content Processing Pipeline**: Processes markdown content to identify and structure page relationships
- **Related Page Engine**: Provides input data for generating "related pages" suggestions based on mention frequency and context

## Usage Example

```javascript
const LinkDiscoveryAgent = require('./lib/agents/link-discovery-agent');

const agent = new LinkDiscoveryAgent();
const content = "This page discusses **Authentication** and relates to User Management concepts.";
const mentions = agent.discoverLinks(content);
// Returns structured data about discovered page mentions with priority rankings
```

## Testing
