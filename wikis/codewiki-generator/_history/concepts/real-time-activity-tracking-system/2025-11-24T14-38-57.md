# [Real-time Activity Tracking System](../_history/_history/concepts/real-time-activity-tracking-system/2025-11-24T14-38-57/2025-11-24T14-38-58.md)

## Purpose and Overview

The [real-time activity tracking system](../_history/_history/concepts/real-time-activity-tracking-system/2025-11-24T14-38-57/2025-11-24T14-38-58.md) provides live monitoring and collaborative features for wiki operations through a centralized dashboard controller. It implements Server-Sent Events for real-time activity streaming and coordinates multiple specialized services to deliver comprehensive wiki management capabilities.

## Key Functionality

**Real-time Activity Monitoring**
- Implements Server-Sent Events endpoint (`getActivityFeed`) for live activity streaming
- Provides keepalive mechanisms and automatic cleanup for persistent connections
- Tracks and broadcasts wiki operations as they occur

**Collaborative Features**
- Comments system with author tracking and content management (`addComment`)
- Planning task management with CRUD operations (`createPlanningTask`)
- Intelligent content suggestions based on wiki analysis (`generateSuggestions`)

**Analytics and Search**
- Comprehensive wiki analytics dashboard (`getWikiAnalytics`)
- Full-text search with relevance scoring (`searchWiki`)
- [Git history integration](../concepts/git-history-integration.md) for version tracking (`getPageHistory`)

**Content Management**
- Table of contents generation with hierarchical organization (`getTableOfContents`)
- AI-powered research functionality for content analysis (`researchContext`)
- YAML frontmatter parsing with metadata extraction (`_parseFrontmatter`)

## Relationships

The system extends the existing WikiManager functionality while maintaining backward compatibility with dashboard endpoints. It coordinates ten specialized services ([WikiContextService](../components/wiki-context-service.md), WikiSearchService, ActivityEventEmitter, PlanningManager, SuggestionEngine, WikiAnalytics, ProjectManager, CommentsManager, GitHistoryService) through a central controller architecture. The ActivityEventEmitter serves as the backbone for real-time monitoring, while other services provide domain-specific functionality accessed through RESTful API patterns.

## Usage Example

```javascript
const DashboardController = require('./lib/dashboard-controller');

// Initialize dashboard controller
const dashboard = new DashboardController(wikiManager);

// Set up real-time activity monitoring
app.get('/api/activity-feed', (req, res) => {
  dashboard.getActivityFeed(req, res);
});

// Search wiki content
const searchResults = await dashboard.searchWiki({ query: 'documentation' });

// Add collaborative comment
await dashboard.addComment({
  pageId: 'getting-started',
  content: 'This section needs more examples',
  author: 'developer'
});
```
