# Commit-driven Documentation Pipeline

## Purpose and Overview

The commit-driven documentation pipeline establishes an automated system where code commits trigger comprehensive analysis and documentation generation. This architectural pattern orchestrates agent-based code analysis with wiki management to maintain up-to-date project documentation without manual intervention.

## Key Functionality

The pipeline operates through several coordinated processes:

- **Commit Processing**: Analyzes incoming commits to identify significant changes and extract relevant code files for documentation
- **File Significance Filtering**: Applies filtering logic to determine which files warrant documentation effort, reducing noise by skipping binary files, deletions, and non-significant changes
- **Context-aware Documentation Generation**: Retrieves related wiki pages as context before analysis and determines appropriate documentation locations using semantic naming conventions (kebab-case concept-to-path mapping)
- **Concept-centric Documentation**: Decomposes code changes into discrete concepts, each managed as independent documentation pages that can be created or updated based on analysis results
- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Orchestrates specialized agents (code analysis, documentation writing, tech debt assessment, security review) through the central Processor class

## Relationships

The pipeline integrates several key components:

- **WikiManager**: Handles creation, retrieval, and updates of documentation pages with methods for searching and managing page relationships
- **StateManager**: Manages processing state and tracks documentation lifecycle across commits
- **Analysis Agents**: Specialized components including CodeAnalysisAgent, DocumentationWriterAgent, TechDebtAgent, and SecurityAgent for different aspects of code evaluation
- **Processor Class**: Central orchestrator that coordinates all managers and agents to execute the complete documentation workflow

## Usage Example

```javascript
const Processor = require('./lib/processor');

// Initialize processor with required managers and agents
const processor = new Processor({
  wikiManager: mockWikiManager,
  stateManager: mockStateManager,
  codeAnalysisAgent: mockCodeAnalysisAgent,
  docWriterAgent: mockDocWriterAgent,
  techDebtAgent: mockTechDebtAgent,
  securityAgent: mockSecurityAgent
});

// Process a commit to generate documentation
await processor.processCommit(commitData);

// Process entire repository for comprehensive documentation
await processor.processRepository(repositoryPath);
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage**: tests/unit/processor.test.js
- 26 test cases across 6 test suites
- Comprehensive testing of core methods: `processCommit`, `isSignificantFile`, `getRelevantContext`, `determinePagePath`, and `processRepository`
- Validates the complete processor workflow including manager coordination and agent orchestration
