# CodeWiki-Generator Architecture

## System Overview

CodeWiki-Generator is an automated documentation system that transforms source code repositories into searchable wiki-style documentation. It scans codebases, extracts metadata and context, and generates structured markdown pages with frontmatter for easy navigation and discovery. The system maintains persistent state to track changes over time and provides a foundation for building comprehensive, always-up-to-date technical documentation from living code.

## Core Architecture

The system follows a **pipeline-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns across configuration, discovery, processing, and persistence layers. It implements the **State Schema Validation Pattern** to ensure data integrity throughout the pipeline and uses **Automatic Metadata Lifecycle Management** to keep documentation synchronized with code changes. The architecture emphasizes **environment-based separation** to enable safe testing and development workflows alongside production documentation generation.

## Major Components

### Configuration Management Layer
The **Singleton configuration module** serves as the central nervous system, implementing **Environment-based configuration with test mode separation**. It provides runtime settings, handles **Mock credential injection for testing**, and ensures consistent behavior across different execution contexts. This component gates all system behavior through validated configuration schemas.

### Content Discovery Engine  
The **Recursive Directory Traversal for Content Discovery** component implements intelligent source code scanning using the **Source code organization pattern**. It identifies documentation targets, respects ignore patterns, and builds the initial content inventory that feeds downstream processing stages.

### Processing Pipeline
The **Wiki Markdown Management System** orchestrates content transformation, working closely with **Content Search with Context Extraction** to generate meaningful documentation. The **Frontmatter Parsing Pattern** and **Frontmatter-based Page Serialization** handle structured metadata extraction and injection, ensuring generated pages contain rich navigational context.

### State Management Layer
**Persistent State Management with Validation** and **File-based State Persistence with Directory Handling** work together to track system state across runs. This enables incremental processing, change detection, and recovery from interrupted operations while maintaining data consistency through validation schemas.

### Output Generation
**Wiki Page Write Operations** handles the final materialization of processed content into the target documentation format. It coordinates with persistence layers to ensure atomic writes and maintains the relationship between source changes and generated documentation.

### Operational Safety
**Graceful Error Handling for File Operations** and **Safe File Operation Pattern** provide cross-cutting reliability concerns, ensuring the system can handle filesystem errors, permission issues, and edge cases without corrupting existing documentation or system state.

## Data Flow

The system processes information through a four-stage pipeline:

```
Source Code → Discovery → Processing → Output
     ↓            ↓          ↓         ↓
Configuration → Content → Metadata → Wiki Pages
     ↓         Inventory    Extract.     ↓
State Mgmt ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← State Update
```

1. **Initialization**: Configuration validation loads settings and initializes state management
2. **Discovery Phase**: Directory traversal identifies source files and builds content inventory
3. **Processing Phase**: Content extraction, metadata generation, and frontmatter creation
4. **Output Phase**: Wiki page generation with state persistence for tracking changes

State flows bidirectionally - the system reads previous state to enable incremental processing and writes updated state after successful operations. Error handling operates as a cross-cutting concern, with fallback and recovery mechanisms at each stage.

## Key Design Decisions

### File-Based State vs Database
**Choice**: Implemented **File-based State Persistence with Directory Handling** rather than database storage  
**Rationale**: Simplifies deployment, reduces external dependencies, and keeps state co-located with generated documentation  
**Trade-offs**: Gained simplicity and portability; limited concurrent access and complex querying capabilities

### Environment Separation Strategy  
**Choice**: **Environment-based configuration with test mode separation** with mock injection  
**Rationale**: Enables safe testing without affecting production systems or requiring complex test infrastructure  
**Trade-offs**: Added configuration complexity; gained reliable test isolation and simplified CI/CD integration

### Frontmatter-Centric Metadata
**Choice**: **Frontmatter-based Page Serialization** as the primary metadata transport mechanism  
**Rationale**: Leverages existing markdown ecosystem tools and provides human-readable metadata  
**Trade-offs**: Gained compatibility with static site generators; limited to YAML-serializable data structures

### Singleton Configuration Pattern
**Choice**: **Singleton configuration module** for system-wide settings access  
**Rationale**: Ensures consistency across components and simplifies dependency management  
**Trade-offs**: Gained simplicity and consistency; reduced testability and increased coupling

### Validation-First Processing
**Choice**: **State Schema Validation Pattern** enforced at persistence boundaries  
**Rationale**: Prevents data corruption and provides clear error messages for configuration issues  
**Trade-offs**: Added processing overhead; gained data integrity and better debugging experience

## Extension Points

### Custom Content Extractors
Extend the **Content Search with Context Extraction** component to handle new file types or extract domain-specific metadata. The system provides hooks for registering custom parsers that integrate with the existing metadata lifecycle.

### Output Format Plugins
The **Wiki Page Write Operations** component can be extended to support additional output formats beyond markdown. Custom serializers can leverage the existing frontmatter infrastructure while generating different target formats.

### State Schema Extensions
Add custom fields to the **State Schema Validation Pattern** to track additional metadata or processing state. Extensions must provide migration paths and maintain backward compatibility with existing state files.

### Configuration Providers
The **Environment-based configuration with test mode separation** can be extended with new configuration sources (cloud services, databases, etc.) while maintaining the existing test isolation guarantees.

### Error Handling Strategies
Extend **Graceful Error Handling for File Operations** with custom recovery strategies, notification systems, or integration with external monitoring tools. The existing error handling framework provides standardized interfaces for plugging in custom behaviors.
