# Coverage-driven Development Practice

## Purpose and Overview

Coverage-driven development practice establishes automated code coverage tracking as an integral part of the development workflow. This approach embeds quality assurance directly into the build process, ensuring that code organization remains testable and coverage metrics are continuously monitored.

## Key Functionality

- **Automated Coverage Collection**: Automatically gathers coverage data from the `lib` directory during test execution
- **Test File Exclusion**: Intelligently excludes test files from coverage calculations to focus on production code quality
- **Development Workflow Integration**: Embeds coverage tracking into the standard development process, making quality metrics visible and actionable
- **Code Organization Enforcement**: Encourages maintainable code structure by requiring testable module organization

## Relationships

This practice works in conjunction with:
- **Test Infrastructure Configuration**: Relies on Jest framework setup for coverage collection and reporting
- **Wiki Manager Modules**: Provides coverage tracking for wiki-related functionality in the `lib` directory
- **Development Workflow**: Integrates with build and CI processes to maintain quality standards
- **Quality Assurance**: Supports broader testing and code quality initiatives

## Usage Example

The coverage-driven development practice is configured through Jest settings and activated during test runs:

```javascript
// Coverage is automatically collected when running tests
npm test

// View coverage reports after test execution
npm run test:coverage
```

The practice ensures that all modules in the `lib` directory are evaluated for coverage while maintaining focus on production code quality through automatic test file exclusion.

## Testing

No automated tests found for the configuration itself, as this represents infrastructure setup rather than application logic.
