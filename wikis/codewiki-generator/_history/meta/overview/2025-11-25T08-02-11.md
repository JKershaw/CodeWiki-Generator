# CodeWiki Generator Overview

An intelligent documentation automation system that analyzes software repositories and generates comprehensive wiki-style documentation using Large Language Model (LLM) agents.

## Core Philosophy

**Code tells you what. Documentation tells you why. History tells you how.**

CodeWiki Generator automatically analyzes your codebase, discovers architectural patterns, and produces structured markdown documentation organized into concepts, components, and guides. The system practices **wiki-driven development**—building features, documenting them through this system, and validating quality through self-documentation.

## Key Capabilities

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to analyze code and generate clear, insightful documentation
- **Specialized Agent System**: Dedicated agents for code analysis, documentation writing, architecture synthesis, and guide generation
- **Automatic Cross-Linking**: Discovers mentions and injects hyperlinks for seamless navigation
- **Category-Based Organization**: Documents organized into concepts/, components/, and guides/
- **Repository Fingerprinting**: Analyzes repository structure to guide documentation generation
- **Resilient JSON Parsing**: Progressive repair for handling unreliable LLM outputs
- **Self-Validating**: Successfully documents its own architecture at 87% quality
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 220+ passing tests with no API costs (all mocks)
- **MCP Integration**: Claude Code and other AI tools can query generated documentation via Model Context Protocol

## Production Status

**🎯 Production-Ready Core | 87% Quality Grade | 18 Pages Generated**

The system has successfully documented itself:
- 9 architectural concepts and design patterns
- 4 implementation components
- 4 operational guides
- 1 auto-generated navigation index

Quality metrics from self-documentation:
- **Overall**: 87% (Grade A)
- **Navigation**: 90% (cross-page linking effectiveness)
- **Completeness**: 85% (major components covered)
- **Usability**: 88% (actionable Getting Started guide)

## System Architecture

The system follows an **architecture synthesis agent pattern** where specialized LLM agents collaborate:

```
Repository → Fingerprinting → Agent Dispatch → Documentation Assembly
                                     ↓
              ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
              │                     │                     │
    ArchitectureOverviewAgent  CodeAnalysisAgent  GuideGenerationAgent
              │                     │                     │
              └─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┘
                                    ↓
                           JSON Response Cleaning
                                    ↓
                      Category-Based Organization
                                    ↓
                        Wiki Index with Auto-Navigation
                                    ↓
                           Markdown Documentation
```

See [[concepts/architecture.md]] for comprehensive architecture documentation.

### Core Components

- **Processor** - Orchestrates analysis and documentation generation
- **ArchitectureOverviewAgent** - Synthesizes high-level architectural insights
- **CodeAnalysisAgent** - Analyzes code structure and design patterns
- **DocumentationWriterAgent** - Generates markdown with code examples
- **GuideGenerationAgent** - Creates operational guides
- **LinkDiscoveryAgent** - Discovers and injects cross-page hyperlinks
- **WikiManager** - Handles markdown file operations and persistence
- **WikiIndexAgent** - Generates navigation structure

## MCP Server Integration

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server enables AI assistants like Claude Code to query your generated wiki documentation for context while developing.

### Available Tools

1. **query_wiki**: Search documentation for relevant context
   - Intelligent context gathering based on task descriptions
   - Returns relevant pages with summaries and navigation links
   - Example: "How do I implement authentication?"

2. **request_documentation**: Queue documentation requests
   - Track missing documentation and priorities
   - Generate metrics for documentation gaps
   - Inform future improvement cycles

### Starting the Server

```bash
npm run mcp-server
# Or with custom wiki path:
node mcp-server.js --wiki ./wikis/your-project
```

Configure Claude Code to connect:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codewiki": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/CodeWiki-Generator/mcp-server.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/CodeWiki-Generator"
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CodeWiki-Generator
npm install
npm test  # Verify installation
```

See [[guides/getting-started.md]] for detailed setup instructions.

### Generate Wiki for Your Project

```bash
# Generate wiki for this repository
node generate-self-wiki.js

# Or use programmatically
const Processor = require('./lib/processor');
const processor = new Processor('./output-wiki');
await processor.processRepository('https://github.com/owner/repo');
```

### Explore Generated Documentation

```bash
ls -la wiki/
# Key pages:
# - wiki/guides/getting-started.md - Setup and usage
# - wiki/concepts/architecture.md - System design
# - wiki/index.md - Navigation hub
```

## Prerequisites and Environment

- **Node.js** 24.x or higher (tested on 22.x)
- **Anthropic API key** (production only—not required for tests)
- **Git** (for repository analysis)

```bash
# Optional: Add API key for production
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Note: API keys not required for testing. All tests use mocks to avoid costs.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

```bash
npm test           # Run full suite (220+ tests)
npm test:watch    # Watch mode for development
```

All tests use mocks—no API costs incurred. The system validates itself through dogfooding: if the documentation generator can't document itself clearly, the documentation system needs improvement.

## Quality Benchmarking

The auto-generated wiki achieves **87% quality** compared to manually-written documentation:

### Strengths
- Explains design rationale and trade-offs better than typical manual wikis
- Comprehensive cross-page navigation with automatic hyperlinking
- Coherent narrative explaining system architecture
- Immediately useful Getting Started guide

### Current Limitations
- Code examples extracted from tests (pending regeneration with better examples)
- Test coverage statistics not yet documented
- Some component relationships could be more detailed

See [[WIKI_COMPARISON_ASSESSMENT.md]] for detailed assessment.

## Cost and Efficiency

- Processing ~100 commits: $3-$5 (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Average per commit: $0.03-$0.05
- Self-documentation of this repository: ~$1-$2

## Development Roadmap

**✅ Complete Phases:**
- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (WikiManager, StateManager, GitHub Integration)
- Phase 2: AI Agent System (all agents implemented)
- Phase 3: Processing Engine (repository processing, state persistence)
- Phase 5: Integration & Polish (cross-linking, code examples)
- Phase 6: MCP Server (Claude Code integration, wiki querying, metrics)

**⏸️ Next Phase:**
- Phase 4: Web Dashboard and interactive UI

## Immediate and Future Improvements

**Short-term** (< 4 hours):
- Enhanced code examples in component pages
- File path references in documentation
- Fresh wiki generation to validate improvements

**Medium-term** (4-8 hours):
- Test coverage extraction and documentation
- Configuration system for customization
- Enhanced component relationship mapping

**Long-term** (8+ hours):
- Web dashboard interface
- Incremental update mode (process only new commits)
- Advanced MCP server features

## How It Works: The Pipeline

1. **Repository Analysis** - Fingerprints structure and patterns
2. **Agent Dispatch** - Routes analysis to specialized LLM agents
3. **Content Generation** - Each agent generates documentation for its domain
4. **Quality Assurance** - Progressive JSON repair and validation
5. **Assembly** - Organizes content into category-based structure
6. **Cross-Linking** - Discovers mentions and injects hyperlinks
7. **Index Generation** - Creates navigable table of contents

## Contributing

This project is in active development. Key contribution areas:
- Phase 4: Web dashboard implementation
- Test coverage extraction and reporting
- Additional specialized agents
- Documentation system improvements

## Self-Validation

This README describes a system that has successfully documented its own architecture at 87% quality. The auto-generated wiki in `wiki/` serves as proof that the system works as described. The quality of self-generated documentation directly validates the quality of the system itself—making this a self-validating project.
