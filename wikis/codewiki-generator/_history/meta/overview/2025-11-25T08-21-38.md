# CodeWiki Generator Overview

## Mission Statement

**Code tells you what. Documentation tells you why. History tells you how.**

CodeWiki Generator automatically analyzes software repositories, discovers architectural patterns, and produces structured markdown documentation organized into concepts, components, and guides—powered by Large Language Model agents.

## Core Value Proposition

This system bridges the gap between code and understanding by using AI to:
- Analyze codebases at scale without manual effort
- Generate documentation that explains design rationale and trade-offs
- Create interconnected knowledge bases with intelligent cross-referencing
- Validate documentation quality through self-documentation (meta-validation)

**Self-Validation Statement**: This project has successfully documented its own architecture at **87% quality**, with auto-generated wiki pages serving as proof of concept.

## System Status

**🎯 Production-Ready Core | 87% Quality | 18 Pages Generated**

- **9 concepts** covering architectural patterns and design decisions
- **4 components** documenting implementation modules
- **4 guides** providing operational documentation
- **1 index** with auto-generated navigation

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Score | Grade |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Overall Quality | 87% | A |
| Navigation & Cross-linking | 90% | A |
| Completeness | 85% | A |
| Usability | 88% | A |

See [[WIKI_COMPARISON_ASSESSMENT.md]] for detailed quality analysis.

## Architecture Overview

The system orchestrates specialized LLM agents working collaboratively:

### Core Components

- **Processor** – Orchestrates repository analysis and documentation generation
- **ArchitectureOverviewAgent** – Synthesizes high-level architectural insights
- **CodeAnalysisAgent** – Analyzes code structure and patterns
- **DocumentationWriterAgent** – Generates markdown with code examples
- **GuideGenerationAgent** – Creates operational guides
- **LinkDiscoveryAgent** – Discovers and injects cross-page hyperlinks
- **WikiManager** – Handles markdown file operations with [[frontmatter-parsing-pattern]]
- **WikiIndexAgent** – Generates navigable table of contents

See [[architecture.md]] for comprehensive architecture documentation.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CodeWiki-Generator
npm install
npm test  # Verify installation
```

### Generate Documentation

```bash
# For this project
node generate-self-wiki.js

# For any repository
const Processor = require('./lib/processor');
const processor = new Processor('./output-wiki');
await processor.processRepository('https://github.com/owner/repo');
```

See [[getting-started.md]] for detailed setup instructions.

## MCP Server for AI Integration

Enable AI assistants like Claude Code to query your wiki for development context.

### Starting the Server

```bash
npm run mcp-server
# Or with custom wiki path
node mcp-server.js --wiki ./wikis/your-project
```

### Available Tools

1. **query_wiki** – Search documentation with intelligent context gathering
2. **request_documentation** – Queue documentation for missing topics

### Claude Code Integration

Configure in your Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codewiki": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/CodeWiki-Generator/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Ask questions like "How do I implement authentication?" and Claude will automatically query the wiki for context.

## Development Philosophy

This project practices **wiki-driven development**:

1. Build a feature
2. Run the wiki generator on the codebase
3. Read the generated documentation
4. If unclear, improve the documentation system
5. Proceed to next feature

**The quality of auto-generated documentation validates the quality of the system itself.** This creates a virtuous cycle where better documentation tools produce better documentation, enabling more confident development.

## How It Works

1. **Repository Analysis** – Fingerprints structure and patterns
2. **Agent Dispatch** – Routes analysis to specialized LLM agents
3. **Content Generation** – Each agent generates documentation for its domain
4. **Quality Assurance** – Progressive JSON repair and response validation
5. **Assembly** – Organizes content into category-based structure
6. **Linking** – Discovers mentions and injects cross-page hyperlinks
7. **Index Generation** – Creates navigable table of contents

This pipeline ensures comprehensive, interconnected, and maintainable documentation at scale.

## Quality Assessment

Auto-generated wiki achieves **87% quality** compared to manual documentation:

### Strengths
✅ Explains design rationale and trade-offs better than typical manual wikis  
✅ Comprehensive cross-page navigation with automatic hyperlinking  
✅ Coherent narrative explaining system architecture  
✅ Immediately useful Getting Started guide  

### Areas for Enhancement
⚠️ Code examples extracted from tests (implemented, pending regeneration)  
⚠️ Test coverage statistics not yet documented  
⚠️ Some component relationships could be more detailed  

## Roadmap & Status

**✅ Phase 1-3**: Core infrastructure and AI agent system complete  
**✅ Phase 5**: Processing engine and cross-page linking implemented  
**✅ Phase 6**: MCP Server integration complete with wiki querying and metrics  
**⏸️ Phase 4**: Web dashboard interface (next priority)

### Immediate Next Steps
- Add code examples to component pages
- Extract and document test coverage statistics
- Generate fresh wiki to validate improvements

## Prerequisites & Setup

- **Node.js** 24.x or higher
- **Anthropic API key** (production use only—not required for tests)
- **Git** (for repository analysis)

**Note**: All tests use mocks to avoid API costs. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` for production.

## Cost Profile

- Processing ~100 commits: $3-$5 with Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Average per commit: $0.03-$0.05
- Self-documentation: ~$1-$2

## Testing & Validation

```bash
npm test              # Run full suite (220+ tests)
npm test:watch       # Watch mode for development
```

All tests use mocks—**no API costs incurred**. The system validates itself through [[coverage-driven-development-practice]].

## Contributing

Key areas for contribution:
- Phase 4: Web dashboard implementation
