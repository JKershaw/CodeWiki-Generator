# CodeWiki Generator Overview

An intelligent documentation automation system that analyzes software repositories and generates comprehensive wiki-style documentation using Large Language Model (LLM) agents.

## Core Philosophy

**Code tells you what. Documentation tells you why. History tells you how.**

CodeWiki Generator automatically analyzes your codebase, discovers architectural patterns, and produces structured markdown documentation organized into concepts, components, and guides. This project practices **wiki-driven development**: build a feature, generate documentation from it, read what was generated, and use that feedback to improve both the feature and the documentation system itself.

The quality of our self-generated documentation validates the quality of the system itself. This repository documents its own architecture at **87% quality** — serving as proof of concept.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to analyze code and generate clear, insightful documentation
- **Specialized Agent System**: Dedicated agents for code analysis, documentation writing, architecture overview, and guide generation
- **Cross-Page Linking**: Automatic hyperlink discovery and injection for seamless navigation
- **Category-Based Organization**: Documents organized into concepts/, components/, and guides/
- **Repository Fingerprinting**: Analyzes repository structure to guide documentation generation
- **Resilient LLM Parsing**: Progressive JSON repair for handling unreliable LLM outputs
- **Test-Driven Development**: 220+ passing tests with comprehensive coverage
- **MCP Server Integration**: Claude Code and other AI tools can query documentation via Model Context Protocol
- **Self-Documenting**: Successfully documents its own architecture (meta-validation)

## Current Status

**Production-Ready Core | 87% Quality | 18 Pages Generated**

The system has successfully documented itself:
- **9 concepts** (architectural patterns and design decisions)
- **4 components** (implementation modules)
- **4 guides** (operational documentation)
- **1 index** (auto-generated navigation)

### Quality Metrics

- **Overall**: 87% (Grade A)
- **Navigation**: 90% (cross-page linking effectiveness)
- **Completeness**: 85% (all major components documented)
- **Usability**: 88% (immediately actionable Getting Started guide)

## How It Works

The system follows an **architecture synthesis agent pattern** where specialized LLM agents collaborate:

```
Repository → Fingerprinting → Agent Dispatch → Documentation Assembly
                                     ↓
              ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
              │                     │                     │

              └─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┘
                                    ↓
                           JSON Response Cleaning
                                    ↓
                      Category-Based Content Organization
                                    ↓
                        Wiki Index with Auto-Navigation
                                    ↓
                           Markdown Documentation
```

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Repository Analysis**: Fingerprints repository structure and patterns
2. **Agent Dispatch**: Routes analysis to specialized LLM agents
3. **Content Generation**: Each agent generates documentation for its domain
4. **Quality Assurance**: Progressive JSON repair and response validation
5. **Assembly**: Organizes content into category-based structure
6. **Linking**: Discovers mentions and injects cross-page hyperlinks
7. **Index Generation**: Creates navigable table of contents

## Core Components

- **Processor** — Orchestrates analysis and documentation generation
- **ArchitectureOverviewAgent** — Synthesizes high-level architectural insights
- **CodeAnalysisAgent** — Analyzes code structure and patterns
- **DocumentationWriterAgent** — Generates markdown with code examples
- **GuideGenerationAgent** — Creates operational guides
- **LinkDiscoveryAgent** — Discovers and injects cross-page hyperlinks
- **WikiManager** — Handles markdown file operations
- **WikiIndexAgent** — Generates navigation structure

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CodeWiki-Generator
npm install
npm test
```

### Generate Documentation

```bash
# Generate wiki for this project
node generate-self-wiki.js

# Or use programmatically
const Processor = require('./lib/processor');
const processor = new Processor('./output-wiki');
await processor.processRepository('https://github.com/owner/repo');
```

### Explore the Generated Wiki

```bash
ls -la wiki/
# Key pages:
# - wiki/guides/getting-started.md
# - wiki/concepts/architecture.md
# - wiki/index.md
```

## MCP Server Integration

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server enables AI assistants like Claude Code to query your generated wiki documentation while developing.

### Starting the Server

```bash
npm run mcp-server
# Or with custom wiki path
node mcp-server.js --wiki ./wikis/your-project
```

### Available Tools

1. **query_wiki**: Search documentation with intelligent context gathering
   - Example: "How do I implement authentication?"

2. **request_documentation**: Queue documentation requests for gaps
   - Tracks priorities and reasons for coverage needs
   - Generates metrics for documentation gaps

### Claude Code Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codewiki": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/CodeWiki-Generator/mcp-server.js"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/CodeWiki-Generator"
    }
  }
}
```

## Quality Assessment

Our auto-generated wiki achieves **87% quality** compared to manually-written documentation.

### Strengths

- Explains design rationale and trade-offs (often superior to manual documentation)
- Cross-page navigation with automatic hyperlinking
- Coherent narrative explaining system architecture
- Immediately useful Getting Started guide

### Current Limitations

- Code examples extracted from tests (implementation in progress)
- Test coverage statistics not yet documented
- Some component relationships could be more detailed

## Prerequisites & Setup

- **Node.js** 24.x or higher (tested on 22.x with warnings)
- **Anthropic API key** (for production; not required for tests)
- **Git** (for repository analysis)

### Environment Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

*Note: API keys are NOT required for running tests. All tests use mocks to avoid API costs.*

## Testing

```bash
npm test           # Run full suite (220+ tests)
npm test:watch    # Watch mode for development
```

All tests use mocks — no API costs incurred.

## Cost Estimation

- Processing ~100 commits: $3–$5 (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Average per commit: $0.03–$0.05
- Self-documentation of this repository: ~$1–$2

## Development Roadmap

**✅ Complete**
- Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Phase 2: AI Agent System
- Phase 3: Processing Engine
- Phase 5: Integration & Polish (Partial)
- Phase 6: MCP Server

**⏸️ Next**
- Phase 4: Web Dashboard Interface

### Immediate Priorities

- Generate fresh wiki with recent improvements
- Test coverage extraction and documentation
- Configuration system for customization
- Enhanced component relationship mapping

## Architecture Insights

The system demonstrates several important architectural principles:

- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent handles a specific domain of documentation, improving both quality and maintainability
- **Progressive Enhancement**: JSON responses can be partially repaired even if entirely malformed, gracefully degrading
- **Self-Validation**: Running the system on itself validates all claims about capability and quality
- **Separation of Concerns**: Wiki management, LLM interaction, and content organization are cleanly separated

## Example Output

Real examples of the system's output:
- [wiki/concepts/architecture.md](wiki/concepts/architecture.md) — System design with design rationale
- [wiki/guides/getting-started.md](wiki/guides/getting-started.md) — Quick start guide
- [wiki/components/architecture-overview-agent.md](wiki/components/architecture-overview-agent.md) — Agent documentation
- [wiki/index.md](wiki/index.md) — Auto-generated navigation hub

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions in these areas:
- Phase 4: Web dashboard implementation
- Test coverage extraction and reporting
- Additional specialized agents
- Documentation system improvements

## Self-Validation

This README describes a system that has successfully documented its own architecture at 87% quality. The auto-generated wiki in the `wiki/` directory serves as proof that the system works as described.
