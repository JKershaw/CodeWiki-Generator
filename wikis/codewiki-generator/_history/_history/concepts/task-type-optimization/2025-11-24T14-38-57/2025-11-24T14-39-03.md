# [Task-type Optimization](../_history/_history/_history/concepts/task-type-optimization/2025-11-24T14-38-57/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-02.md)

## Purpose and Overview

[Task-type Optimization](../_history/_history/_history/concepts/task-type-optimization/2025-11-24T14-38-57/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-02.md) provides specialized context gathering strategies for different development workflows within the wiki research system. It tailors documentation retrieval by applying task-specific layer priorities and depth limits, ensuring AI agents receive the most relevant information for features, bugs, architectural work, or onboarding tasks.

## Key Functionality

The system optimizes context gathering through predefined configurations for common task types:

- **Feature tasks** - Prioritizes code components and architectural concepts with moderate depth
- **Bug tasks** - Focuses on quality documentation, testing guides, and relevant code components  
- **Architectural tasks** - Emphasizes high-level concepts, meta-documentation, and system design
- **Onboarding tasks** - Balances guides, concepts, and components for comprehensive understanding

Each task type configuration specifies which wiki layers to search, their priority order, and maximum depth limits to prevent information overload while ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## Relationships

[Task-type Optimization](../_history/_history/_history/concepts/task-type-optimization/2025-11-24T14-38-57/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-02.md) integrates tightly with the [Context-aware Research System](../_history/concepts/context-aware-research-system/2025-11-24T14-38-57.md), providing the strategic layer for intelligent documentation retrieval. It consumes task descriptions and produces optimized search parameters that guide the [Multi-layer Wiki Architecture](../_history/concepts/multi-layer-wiki-architecture/2025-11-24T14-38-57.md) traversal. The optimization decisions directly influence which documentation sections AI agents receive, making it a critical component in the decision-making pipeline.

## Usage Example

```javascript
const WikiResearcher = require('./lib/wiki-researcher');

const researcher = new WikiResearcher(wikiManager);

// Get optimized context for a specific task type
const context = await researcher.getContextForTaskType('feature', 'implement user authentication');

// Or use with custom options in general context gathering
const customContext = await researcher.gatherContext('fix login bug', {
  taskType: 'bug',
  maxPages: 10,
  layers: ['quality', 'components']
});
```
