# [Git History Integration for Wiki Pages](../_history/_history/_history/concepts/git-history-integration-for-wiki-pages/2025-11-24T14-38-57/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-02.md)

## Purpose and Overview

The [Git History Integration](../concepts/git-history-integration.md) provides version control visibility within the wiki interface, enabling users to track page changes and understand content evolution over time. This client-side component creates an interactive timeline visualization of git commits associated with wiki pages, complete with author information, timestamps, and commit details.

## Key Functionality

- **Timeline Visualization**: Creates an interactive visual representation of git commit history with author avatars, relative timestamps, and commit details
- **Lazy Loading**: Fetches commit data on-demand when users request to view history, improving initial page load performance
- **Author Display**: Generates avatar initials from commit author names and displays author information for each commit
- **Relative Timestamps**: Converts absolute timestamps to human-readable relative time strings (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago")
- **Smooth UI Interactions**: Provides toggle functionality to show/hide the history panel with smooth scrolling effects
- **Error Handling**: Manages API failures and displays appropriate error states when commit data cannot be retrieved

The system works by connecting to backend API endpoints that serve git history data, then rendering this information as an interactive timeline interface within the wiki page.

## Relationships

- **Backend Integration**: Connects to backend API endpoints for retrieving git history data from repositories
- **Wiki System Integration**: Integrates with the wiki page rendering system through `window.wikiData` to access page-specific information
- **Dashboard Features**: Functions as part of the broader dashboard enhancement features, providing additional context and functionality for wiki content management

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Initialize the git history manager for a wiki page
const historyManager = new GitHistoryManager();

// Toggle the history panel visibility
historyManager.toggleHistory();

// The component automatically handles:
// - Fetching commit data from API endpoints
// - Rendering the timeline with commit details
// - Converting timestamps to relative time formats
// - Generating author avatars and displaying commit information
```

## Testing

No automated tests are currently available for this component. Testing should focus on API integration, timeline rendering, and user interaction flows.
