# [Concept-to-Page Path Mapping with Naming Conventions](../_history/_history/_history/components/concept-to-page-path-mapping-with-naming-conventions/2025-11-24T14-38-56/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-01.md)

## Purpose and Overview

The concept-to-page path mapping system standardizes how documentation concepts are organized within the wiki by converting human-readable concept names into consistent, predictable file paths. This component ensures that documentation maintains a uniform structure using kebab-case naming under a `components/` directory hierarchy, enabling reliable discoverability and maintainability of wiki pages across the documentation system.

## Key Functionality

The `determinePagePath` function implements the core mapping logic by:

- Converting concept names from natural language format to standardized kebab-case paths
- Organizing all concept documentation under a consistent `components/` directory structure
- Ensuring naming consistency across the entire wiki, making page locations predictable
- Supporting the documentation workflow by providing a deterministic way to locate or create concept pages

This mapping occurs as part of the `processConceptDocumentation` workflow, where each concept extracted from code changes is automatically assigned a page path before being created or updated in the wiki. By standardizing paths upfront, the system eliminates ambiguity about where documentation should live and makes it simple to retrieve existing pages for updates.

## Relationships

The path mapping component integrates with the broader documentation pipeline:

- **WikiManager**: Uses mapped paths to perform CRUD operations (`getPage`, `createPage`, `updatePage`) on wiki pages
- **Processor**: Invokes `determinePagePath` during concept documentation processing to establish page locations before wiki operations
- **ProcessConceptDocumentation workflow**: Receives mapped paths as output and uses them to retrieve existing pages or create new ones with consistent locations

## Usage Example

```javascript
const Processor = require('./lib/processor');

const processor = new Processor(wikiManager, codeAnalysisAgent, docWriterAgent, stateManager);

// Internally, processConceptDocumentation calls determinePagePath:
const concept = {
  name: "[Agent-based code analysis and documentation generation](../_history/_history/concepts/agent-based-code-analysis-and-documentation-generation/2025-11-24T14-38-57/2025-11-24T14-38-58.md)",
  category: "concept"
};

// The path mapping converts this to: "components/agent-based-code-analysis-and-documentation-generation.md"
// This path is then used by WikiManager for page operations
const pagePath = processor.determinePagePath(concept.name);
const existingPage = await wikiManager.getPage(pagePath);
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage validates the path mapping functionality:

- **Test Suite**: `tests/unit/processor.test.js`
- **Test Cases**: 26 total tests across 6 test suites
- **Specific Coverage**: Dedicated test suite for `determinePagePath` validates naming convention consistency, kebab-case conversion, and directory structure adherence

Tests verify that concept names are reliably transformed into standardized paths and that the mapping consistently produces the same output for identical inputs, ensuring predictable wiki organization.
