# [Progressive Search with Live Results](../_history/_history/_history/components/progressive-search-with-live-results/2025-11-24T14-38-56/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-01.md)

## Purpose and Overview

The progressive search component provides real-time search functionality for wiki pages with live dropdown results, error handling, and intuitive user interactions. It enables users to search wiki content dynamically without page refreshes, displaying formatted results with pagination and metadata as they type.

## Key Functionality

- **Live Search**: Triggers API calls as users type in the search input field
- **Dynamic Results Display**: Renders search results in a dropdown with titles, snippets, and metadata
- **Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly error messages when search requests fail
- **Click-Outside Dismissal**: Automatically hides search results when users click elsewhere
- **Pagination Support**: Displays paginated results with navigation controls
- **XSS Protection**: Escapes HTML content in search results to prevent security vulnerabilities

The component integrates with wiki API endpoints to fetch search results and formats them using existing page structure and CSS classes. It coordinates with the broader [client-side wiki enhancement system](../concepts/client-side-wiki-enhancement-system.md) to provide seamless navigation and user experience.

## Relationships

- **API Integration**: Makes requests to wiki search endpoints for result data
- **DOM Dependencies**: Relies on specific CSS classes and HTML structure for search forms and result containers
- **Wiki Enhancement System**: Functions as part of the larger `Client-side wiki enhancement system` alongside TOC generation and related pages
- **Global Context**: Uses `window.wikiData` for project context and page metadata when available

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Search functionality is automatically initialized when the page loads
// The search input field triggers live results as users type

// Example of manual initialization if needed:
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Initialize search on elements with appropriate classes
    const searchForm = document.querySelector('.search-form');
    if (searchForm) {
        initSearch(); // Sets up event listeners and API integration
    }
});
```

## Testing

No automated tests are currently available for this component. Testing should focus on search input responsiveness, API error handling, result formatting, and click-outside behavior across different browsers and devices.
