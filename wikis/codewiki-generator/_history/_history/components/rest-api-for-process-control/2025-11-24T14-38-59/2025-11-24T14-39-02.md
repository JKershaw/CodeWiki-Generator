# [REST API for Process Control](../_history/_history/_history/components/rest-api-for-process-control/2025-11-24T14-38-56/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-01.md)

## Purpose and Overview

The [REST API for Process Control](../_history/_history/_history/components/rest-api-for-process-control/2025-11-24T14-38-56/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-01.md) provides a set of HTTP endpoints that enable external control of processing operations through both the web dashboard UI and programmatic requests. It establishes a standardized interface for managing core processing workflows (start, pause, step, batch operations), abstracting the control layer from the underlying process logic and allowing multiple interaction modes with the system.

## Key Functionality

The REST API exposes the following process control endpoints:

- **POST /process/start** - Initiates a processing operation
- **POST /process/pause** - Pauses an active processing operation
- **POST /process/step** - Executes a single processing step
- **POST /process/batch** - Triggers batch processing operations

Additionally, the API provides status information:

- **GET /api/status** - Returns the current processing status as JSON, enabling dashboard updates and external monitoring

These endpoints are centrally managed through the `DashboardController` class, which handles request routing and delegates presentation logic from the main server. All endpoints respond with appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON payloads suitable for both UI consumption and programmatic integration.

## Relationships

The [REST API for Process Control](../_history/_history/_history/components/rest-api-for-process-control/2025-11-24T14-38-56/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-01.md) integrates with several other system components:

- **DashboardController** - Acts as the central handler for all process control requests, abstracting presentation logic from Express route handlers
- **[Web Dashboard Architecture](../concepts/web-dashboard-architecture.md)** - Consumes process control endpoints to drive UI interactions and reflect real-time system state
- **Core Processing System** - The endpoints provide the primary interface for triggering and managing actual processing operations

The API design follows a layered architecture pattern where routing is separated from business logic, allowing the same endpoints to serve both dashboard requests and external integrations.

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Making a request to start processing
const response = await fetch('/process/start', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const result = await response.json();

// Retrieving current processing status
const statusResponse = await fetch('/api/status');
const status = await statusResponse.json();
console.log('Current status:', status);

// Pausing an active operation
const pauseResponse = await fetch('/process/pause', {
  method: 'POST'
});
```

## Testing

Test coverage is provided through `tests/integration/server.test.js` with 11 test cases across 6 test suites, covering:

- Express Server configuration
- Health Check endpoints
- Static File Serving
- View Engine setup
- Error Handling
- Middleware Configuration

The integration tests validate that all routes are properly configured and respond with appropriate status codes and content types.
