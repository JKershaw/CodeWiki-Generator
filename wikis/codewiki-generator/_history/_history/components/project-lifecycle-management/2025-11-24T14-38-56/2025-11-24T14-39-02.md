# [Project Lifecycle Management](../_history/_history/_history/components/project-lifecycle-management/2025-11-24T14-38-56/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-01.md)

## Purpose and Overview

The [project lifecycle management](../_history/_history/_history/components/project-lifecycle-management/2025-11-24T14-38-56/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-01.md) component provides comprehensive CRUD operations for wiki projects, handling complete project workflows including creation, import, deletion, and configuration management. It serves as the central orchestrator for project operations within the [comprehensive wiki dashboard system](../_history/concepts/comprehensive-wiki-dashboard-system/2025-11-24T14-38-57.md), managing project metadata, validation, and settings persistence throughout the entire project lifecycle.

## Key Functionality

The [project lifecycle management](../_history/_history/_history/components/project-lifecycle-management/2025-11-24T14-38-56/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-01.md) system offers several core capabilities:

- **Project Creation**: Creates new wiki projects with initial configuration and metadata setup through the `createProject` function
- **Project Import**: Imports existing projects from external sources with validation and structure preservation  
- **Project Deletion**: Safely removes projects with cleanup of associated resources and dependencies
- **Settings Management**: Manages project configuration, preferences, and metadata with validation and persistence
- **Metadata Handling**: Processes project metadata and configuration data for structured storage and retrieval
- **Integration Coordination**: Works seamlessly with specialized services like WikiManager, ProjectManager, and analytics systems

The component operates as part of the [multi-service dashboard architecture](../_history/concepts/multi-service-dashboard-architecture/2025-11-24T14-38-57.md), providing RESTful API endpoints for all project lifecycle operations while maintaining activity tracking and real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Relationships

This component operates as a central hub within the dashboard controller system:

- **Extends WikiManager**: Builds upon existing wiki functionality with enhanced project management capabilities
- **Integrates with Activity Feed Tracking**: All project operations are monitored through the activity feed system for real-time updates
- **Connects to Wiki Analytics**: Project lifecycle events feed into the analytics system via `getWikiAnalytics` for usage insights
- **Coordinates with Search and Navigation**: New and modified projects are integrated into the wiki search system through `searchWiki`
- **Links to Planning System**: Project creation and management connect with the planning interface via `renderPlanning`
- **Maintains Version Control Integration**: Project changes are tracked through git-based history systems

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Project creation with configuration
const newProject = await createProject({
  name: 'My Wiki Project',
  description: 'Documentation project',
  settings: { theme: 'default', visibility: 'public' }
});

// Accessing project analytics
const analytics = await getWikiAnalytics(projectId);

// Managing project lifecycle events
const activity = await getActivityFeed();
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage**: tests/integration/server.test.js covers the underlying server infrastructure with 11 test cases across 6 test suites, including Express Server, Health Check, Static File Serving, View Engine, Error Handling, and Middleware Configuration. Specific [project lifecycle management](../_history/_history/_history/components/project-lifecycle-management/2025-11-24T14-38-56/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-01.md) functionality requires additional test coverage for creation, import, deletion, and settings management operations.
