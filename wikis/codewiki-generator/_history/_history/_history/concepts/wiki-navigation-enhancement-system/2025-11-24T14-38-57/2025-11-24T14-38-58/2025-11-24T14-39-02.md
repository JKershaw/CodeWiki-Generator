# Wiki Navigation Enhancement System

## Purpose and Overview

The wiki navigation enhancement system automatically improves the discoverability and navigation of wiki content by adding breadcrumbs and intelligent tags to markdown files. It processes existing wiki structures and enriches them with hierarchical navigation paths and category-based tagging without requiring manual intervention.

## Key Functionality

The system operates through several coordinated components:

- **Automated Discovery**: Recursively scans wiki directories to find all markdown files using `getAllMarkdownFiles()`
- **Breadcrumb Generation**: Creates hierarchical navigation paths based on file system structure through `generateBreadcrumb()`
- **Intelligent Tagging**: Uses the [category-based tag suggestion engine](../components/category-based-tag-suggestion-engine.md) with predefined `TAG_SUGGESTIONS` mappings to automatically assign relevant tags
- **Frontmatter Enhancement**: Enriches existing YAML frontmatter with navigation metadata and tags via `enhanceFrontmatter()`

The tag suggestion engine analyzes content categories and applies appropriate tags from predefined mappings, making wiki pages more discoverable through consistent categorization.

## Relationships

- **Integrates with existing wiki infrastructure**: Works directly with established markdown file structures and YAML frontmatter formats
- **Complements wiki generation systems**: Adds discoverability features that enhance static site generators and wiki platforms
- **Extends category-based organization**: Builds upon existing categorization established by other wiki management tools
- **Supports hierarchical navigation**: Leverages file system structure to create logical breadcrumb trails

## Usage Example

```javascript
const { addBreadcrumbsAndTags } = require('./add-breadcrumbs-and-tags');

// Process all wiki files to add breadcrumbs and tags
addBreadcrumbsAndTags();

// The system will automatically:
// - Find all markdown files in the wiki directory
// - Generate breadcrumbs based on file paths
// - Apply relevant tags using TAG_SUGGESTIONS mapping
// - Update frontmatter with enhanced navigation metadata
```

## Testing

No automated tests are currently available for this component. Testing would benefit from coverage of the breadcrumb generation logic, tag suggestion accuracy, and frontmatter enhancement functionality.
