# Context-aware Documentation Querying

## Purpose and Overview

The Context-aware Documentation Querying system provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI tools like Claude Code to intelligently search and retrieve documentation from the project wiki. It implements JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio to facilitate seamless integration with AI development workflows, allowing tools to gather contextual documentation based on specific tasks and queries.

## Key Functionality

The system centers around the `MCPServer` class which handles JSON-RPC communication and routes requests to specialized handlers:

- **Intelligent Wiki Search**: Uses WikiResearcher to perform context-aware searches with [task-type optimization](../concepts/task-type-optimization.md) and relevance scoring
- **[Documentation Request Tracking](../components/documentation-request-tracking.md)**: Captures and prioritizes requests for missing documentation to identify gaps in the knowledge base
- **Structured Response Formatting**: Transforms search results into structured formats optimized for AI tool consumption
- **Real-time Communication**: Maintains persistent stdio connection for efficient query processing

The server processes incoming requests through `handleRequest`, which routes to either `queryWiki` for documentation searches or `requestDocumentation` for tracking missing content. Search results are processed by `formatWikiResponse` to ensure consistent, AI-friendly output formatting.

## Relationships

The MCP server integrates deeply with the existing documentation ecosystem:

- **WikiResearcher Integration**: Leverages the wiki search engine for intelligent context gathering and relevance scoring
- **Wiki Management System**: Extends the core documentation workflow by providing programmatic access for AI tools
- **Metrics and Quality Systems**: Connects to tracking systems to monitor documentation usage patterns and identify improvement opportunities
- **Claude Code Integration**: Serves as the primary bridge between AI development tools and the project's knowledge base

## Usage Example

```javascript
const MCPServer = require('./mcp-server');

// Initialize the MCP server for Claude Code integration
const server = new MCPServer();

// Handle incoming JSON-RPC requests from AI tools
server.handleRequest({
  method: 'queryWiki',
  params: { query: 'authentication patterns', taskType: 'implementation' }
});

// Track requests for missing documentation
server.requestDocumentation({
  topic: 'API rate limiting',
  priority: 'high',
  context: 'development workflow'
});
```

## Testing

No automated tests are currently available for this component. Testing should focus on JSON-RPC protocol compliance, wiki integration accuracy, and response formatting consistency.
