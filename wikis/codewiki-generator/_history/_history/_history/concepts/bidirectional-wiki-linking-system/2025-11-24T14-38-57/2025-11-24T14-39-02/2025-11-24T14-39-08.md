# Bidirectional Wiki Linking System

## Purpose and Overview

The bidirectional wiki linking system transforms isolated markdown files into a connected knowledge graph by automatically inserting cross-references between related pages. It implements Wikipedia-style automatic linking, creating a web of connections that helps users discover related content across the wiki.

## Key Functionality

This system processes all wiki pages to identify mentions of other page titles within content and converts them into proper markdown links. The core functionality includes:

- **Intelligent mention detection**: Uses the `LinkDiscoveryAgent` class to find references to other page titles within markdown content
- **[Context-aware link insertion](../components/context-aware-link-insertion.md)**: Prevents duplicate links by checking if text is already part of existing markdown links through `isAlreadyLinked()`
- **Format preservation**: Maintains original text formatting (like bold text) when creating new cross-references via `createMarkdownLink()`
- **Relative path handling**: Generates proper relative markdown links that work within the wiki structure

The system operates as a post-processing enhancement, running after the initial wiki generation to add these automatic cross-references.

## Relationships

- **Depends on WikiManager**: Accesses page content, metadata, and structure information
- **Uses LinkDiscoveryAgent**: Leverages specialized logic for finding potential cross-reference opportunities
- **Integrates with frontmatter structure**: Works within the existing wiki architecture that uses frontmatter for page metadata
- **Complements wiki generation**: Functions as an enhancement layer that adds value to the base wiki system

## Usage Example

```javascript
const { enhanceBidirectionalLinks } = require('./enhance-wiki-linking');

// Process all wiki pages to add automatic cross-links
enhanceBidirectionalLinks(wikiManager);
```

The main `enhanceBidirectionalLinks()` function serves as the orchestrator, taking a wiki manager instance and processing all pages to add bidirectional links. The function handles the entire workflow of discovery, validation, and link insertion across the wiki content.
