# Sandboxed E2E Testing Configuration

## Purpose and Overview

The Sandboxed E2E Testing Configuration provides a specialized Playwright setup optimized for running end-to-end tests in restricted environments such as Docker containers and CI/CD pipelines. It disables Chrome's sandbox security features and resource-intensive functionality to ensure reliable test execution in constrained environments.

## Key Functionality

This configuration adapts browser automation for environments with limited system resources or security restrictions by:

- **Disabling Chrome Sandbox**: Bypasses Chrome's security sandbox that may conflict with containerized environments
- **Serial Test Execution**: Prevents parallel test execution to avoid resource contention in memory-constrained systems  
- **Resource Optimization**: Configures Chrome launch arguments to disable features that require significant system resources
- **CI/CD Compatibility**: Ensures tests can run reliably in automated deployment pipelines and Docker containers

The configuration includes specific Chrome flags in `launchOptions.args` that disable sandbox restrictions and optimize browser performance for testing environments.

## Relationships

- **[E2E Testing Infrastructure](../components/e2e-testing-infrastructure.md)**: Serves as the foundation configuration for the project's end-to-end testing framework
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Enables automated testing in deployment workflows by handling environment constraints
- **Browser Automation**: Configures Playwright's browser launch behavior to work within system limitations
- **Resource Management**: Coordinates with system resources by preventing parallel execution and reducing browser overhead

## Usage Example

```javascript
// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  use: {
    launchOptions: {
      args: [
        '--no-sandbox',
        '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
        '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
        '--disable-gpu'
      ]
    }
  },
  workers: 1, // Serial execution
  // Additional Playwright configuration...
};
```

## Testing

No automated tests found for this configuration file. Testing is typically validated through successful execution of the E2E test suite in target environments.
