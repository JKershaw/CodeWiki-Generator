# WikiResearcher

## Purpose and Overview

The WikiResearcher provides context-aware research capabilities for multi-layer wiki documentation systems. It intelligently gathers relevant documentation by searching across structured layers (meta, concepts, components, guides, history, quality) and assembles task-specific context packages to help AI agents make informed decisions.

## Key Functionality

**Context Gathering**
- Extracts keywords from task descriptions and searches across all wiki layers
- Ranks pages by relevance using keyword matching in titles, paths, and metadata
- Assembles comprehensive context packages tailored to specific needs

**Multi-layer Architecture Support**
- Searches across distinct documentation layers: meta/, concepts/, components/, guides/, history/, and quality/
- Provides structured access to different types of documentation based on task requirements

**[Task-type Optimization](../_history/_history/_history/concepts/task-type-optimization/2025-11-24T14-38-57/2025-11-24T14-38-58/2025-11-24T14-39-02.md)**
- Offers specialized context gathering for different task types (feature, bug, architectural, onboarding)
- Applies tailored layer priorities and depth limits based on task characteristics
- Optimizes search strategies for specific workflow patterns

**Intelligent Ranking**
- Calculates relevance scores based on keyword matches across multiple page attributes
- Prioritizes results to surface the most pertinent documentation first

## Relationships

- **WikiManager**: Depends on WikiManager for accessing wiki pages and retrieving metadata from the underlying documentation structure
- **ClaudeClient**: Integrates with ClaudeClient for potential AI-enhanced ranking and relevance scoring
- **AI Agents**: Produces structured context packages that AI agents consume for decision-making processes
- **Wiki Management**: Complements existing wiki management systems by adding an intelligent retrieval and context assembly layer

## Usage Example

```javascript
const WikiResearcher = require('./lib/wiki-researcher');

// Initialize researcher
const researcher = new WikiResearcher();

// Gather context for a task
const context = await researcher.gatherContext('implement user authentication', {
  maxPages: 10,
  layers: ['concepts', 'components', 'guides']
});

// Get optimized context for specific task type
const featureContext = await researcher.getContextForTaskType('feature', 'add login functionality');

// Format as markdown report
const report = researcher.formatContextReport(context);
```
