# Collaborative Wiki Features

## Purpose and Overview

The collaborative wiki features provide a comprehensive suite of team-based functionality for wiki development, including real-time activity tracking, commenting systems, content suggestions, and project planning management. This system extends the existing WikiManager with specialized services that enable multiple users to collaborate effectively on wiki content creation and maintenance.

## Key Functionality

The collaborative features are implemented through a multi-service architecture coordinated by the dashboard controller:

- **Real-time Activity Tracking**: Server-Sent Events implementation streams live updates of wiki activities with keepalive mechanisms and automatic cleanup
- **Commenting System**: Full CRUD operations for collaborative discussions on wiki pages with author tracking and content management
- **Content Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestion engine that analyzes wiki patterns to recommend improvements and new content
- **Project Planning**: Task management system for organizing wiki development with lifecycle management and metadata handling
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive metrics for wiki usage, content analysis, and team collaboration insights
- **Search Integration**: Full-text indexing with relevance scoring for efficient content discovery
- **[Git History Integration](../concepts/git-history-integration.md)**: Version tracking and change analysis through git repository integration
- **Research Context**: AI-powered research functionality for content analysis and exploration

## Relationships

The collaborative features integrate with several core components:

- **Extends WikiManager**: Builds upon existing wiki functionality while maintaining backward compatibility
- **ActivityEventEmitter**: Coordinates real-time event broadcasting across all collaborative features
- **Specialized Services**: Orchestrates 10 service classes ([WikiContextService](../components/wiki-context-service.md), WikiSearchService, PlanningManager, SuggestionEngine, WikiAnalytics, ProjectManager, CommentsManager, GitHistoryService, etc.)
- **RESTful API**: Implements standardized API patterns for all collaborative endpoints
- **Git Integration**: Connects with version control systems for change tracking and history analysis

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Real-time activity feed
app.get('/api/activity-feed', dashboardController.getActivityFeed);

// Collaborative commenting
app.post('/api/comments', dashboardController.addComment);
app.get('/api/comments/:pageId', dashboardController.getComments);

// Content suggestions and planning
app.post('/api/suggestions', dashboardController.generateSuggestions);
app.post('/api/planning/tasks', dashboardController.createPlanningTask);

// Analytics and search
app.get('/api/analytics', dashboardController.getWikiAnalytics);
app.get('/api/search', dashboardController.searchWiki);
```

## Testing

No automated tests are currently available for the collaborative wiki features. Testing coverage should be implemented to validate the multi-service architecture, real-time event handling, and collaborative workflow functionality.
