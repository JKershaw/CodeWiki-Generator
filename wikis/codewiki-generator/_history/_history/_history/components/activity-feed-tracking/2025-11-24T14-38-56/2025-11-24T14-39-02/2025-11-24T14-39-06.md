# Activity Feed Tracking

## Purpose and Overview

The activity feed tracking component provides real-time monitoring of wiki processing activities with persistent history and management capabilities. It enables users to track all operations across wiki projects, maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of content changes, project modifications, and user interactions within the dashboard system.

## Key Functionality

The activity feed tracking component operates through several key functions that capture and manage wiki activities:

- **Real-time Activity Monitoring**: Captures all major wiki operations including page edits, project creation, comment additions, and search activities
- **Persistent Activity History**: Maintains a comprehensive log of activities that can be retrieved and displayed in the dashboard
- **Activity Stream Management**: Provides formatted activity data for dashboard display with timestamps and user context
- **Integration with Core Operations**: Automatically tracks activities from wiki editing, project management, commenting, and search functions

The component works by intercepting calls to major wiki operations and logging relevant activity data, which is then made available through the `getActivityFeed` function for dashboard consumption.

## Relationships

The activity feed tracking component serves as a central monitoring hub that connects to multiple system components:

- **Links to Wiki Operations**: Integrates with `saveWikiEdit`, `searchWiki`, and content management functions to track user interactions
- **Project Management Integration**: Connects with `createProject` and [project lifecycle management](../_history/components/project-lifecycle-management/2025-11-24T14-38-56.md) to monitor project-level activities  
- **Collaborative Features**: Tracks activities from `addComment` and suggestion generation for team collaboration monitoring
- **Dashboard Controller Extension**: Extends the existing dashboardController to provide activity data for the main dashboard interface
- **Git Version Control**: Works alongside `getPageHistory` to provide activity context for version-controlled changes

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Retrieve current activity feed for dashboard display
const activities = await getActivityFeed();

// Activity feed automatically captures events from other operations
await saveWikiEdit(pageData); // This will generate an activity entry
await createProject(projectConfig); // This will generate an activity entry
await addComment(pageId, commentData); // This will generate an activity entry

// Activities are accessible through the dashboard system
console.log('Recent activities:', activities);
```

## Testing
