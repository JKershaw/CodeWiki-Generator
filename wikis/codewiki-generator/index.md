# CodeWiki-Generator

A comprehensive documentation system that integrates Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with automated wiki generation and interactive documentation features. This project bridges AI-powered code analysis with structured documentation management, enabling dynamic content generation and seamless developer workflows.

## Concepts

Core architectural principles and theoretical foundations that guide the system design.

- [Defensive Chart Rendering](concepts/defensive-chart-rendering.md) - Error-resistant chart generation with graceful fallback mechanisms
- [MCP Documentation Request System](concepts/mcp-documentation-request-system.md) - Structured approach for requesting and managing documentation through MCP protocols
- [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Integration](concepts/model-context-protocol-(mcp)-server-integration.md) - Integration patterns for connecting MCP servers with documentation workflows
- [Architecture](concepts/architecture.md) - Overall system architecture and component relationships

## Components

Individual modules and systems that implement the core functionality.

- [Documentation Gap Tracking System](components/documentation-gap-tracking-system.md) - Automated detection and monitoring of missing or incomplete documentation
- [Interactive MCP Client](components/interactive-mcp-client.md) - Real-time client interface for communicating with MCP servers
- [Interactive MCP Communication Pattern](components/interactive-mcp-communication-pattern.md) - Standardized patterns for bidirectional MCP server communication
- [Markdown Link Normalization](components/markdown-link-normalization.md) - Automated processing and standardization of markdown cross-references
- [MCP JSON-RPC Testing Framework](components/mcp-json-rpc-testing-framework.md) - Comprehensive testing suite for MCP protocol implementations
- [Wiki-to-AI Query Bridge](components/wiki-to-ai-query-bridge.md) - Interface layer connecting wiki content with AI-powered query processing

## Guides

Step-by-step instructions and practical examples for using the system.

- [MCP Protocol Demonstration](guides/mcp-protocol-demonstration.md) - Hands-on walkthrough of MCP protocol implementation and usage

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the [Architecture](concepts/architecture.md) to understand the overall system design
2. Review [MCP Protocol Demonstration](guides/mcp-protocol-demonstration.md) for practical implementation examples
3. Explore individual components based on your specific use case
4. Use the [Interactive MCP Client](components/interactive-mcp-client.md) for hands-on experimentation
