# CodeWiki-Generator

A comprehensive documentation generation system that leverages AI agents to automatically create and maintain technical documentation for software repositories. This system provides intelligent analysis of codebases and generates structured wikis with architectural overviews, operational guides, and detailed component documentation.

### Concepts

Core principles and patterns that drive the documentation generation system:

- **[Architecture synthesis agent pattern](concepts/architecture-synthesis-agent-pattern.md)** - Agent-based approach for analyzing and synthesizing system architecture documentation
- **[Category-based content organization](concepts/category-based-content-organization.md)** - Systematic approach to organizing documentation content into logical categories
- **[JSON response cleaning for LLM APIs](concepts/json-response-cleaning-for-llm-apis.md)** - Techniques for sanitizing and validating JSON responses from language model APIs
- **[Operational documentation generation](concepts/operational-documentation-generation.md)** - Automated creation of operational guides and procedural documentation
- **[Operational Guide Generation](concepts/operational-guide-generation.md)** - System for generating comprehensive operational procedures and workflows
- **[Repository fingerprinting](concepts/repository-fingerprinting.md)** - Method for creating unique identifiers and signatures for code repositories
- **[Resilient LLM response parsing](concepts/resilient-llm-response-parsing.md)** - Robust strategies for handling and parsing variable language model outputs
- **[System-level documentation generation](concepts/system-level-documentation-generation.md)** - Comprehensive approach to documenting entire system architectures
- **[Wiki index generation system](concepts/wiki-index-generation-system.md)** - Automated system for creating and maintaining wiki navigation indexes
- **[Wiki index generation with auto-navigation](concepts/wiki-index-generation-with-auto-navigation.md)** - Enhanced wiki indexing with intelligent navigation structure generation

### Components

Key technical components and implementation details:

- **[ArchitectureOverviewAgent](components/architecture-overview-agent.md)** - AI agent responsible for analyzing and documenting system architecture
- **[GuideGenerationAgent](components/guide-generation-agent.md)** - Specialized agent for creating step-by-step operational guides
- **[Progressive JSON repair strategy](components/progressive-json-repair-strategy.md)** - Multi-stage approach for repairing malformed JSON responses from AI systems
- **[Repository Structure Analysis](components/repository-structure-analysis.md)** - Component for analyzing and mapping repository organization and dependencies
- **[Architecture Overview](concepts/architecture.md)** - High-level architectural documentation and system design principles

## 🚀 Getting Started
