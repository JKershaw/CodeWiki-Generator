# CodeWiki Generator

A comprehensive documentation generation system that creates intelligent, cross-linked wikis from codebases. The system analyzes code structure, discovers relationships, and generates contextually-rich documentation with automatic cross-referencing and test-driven examples.

## Getting Started

New to CodeWiki Generator? Start with these essential guides:

- **[Getting Started](guides/getting-started.md)** - Quick setup and first steps
- **[Architecture Overview](concepts/architecture.md)** - Understanding the system design
- **[Development Workflow](guides/development-workflow.md)** - How to work with the codebase

## Concepts

Core architectural and design concepts that drive the system:

- **[Context-enriched Documentation Generation](concepts/context-enriched-documentation-generation.md)** - Intelligent documentation that understands code relationships and usage patterns
- **[Cross-linking System](concepts/cross-linking-system.md)** - Automatic discovery and creation of relationships between documentation pages
- **[Cross-page Linking System](concepts/cross-page-linking-system.md)** - Advanced linking mechanisms for seamless navigation between related content
- **[Enhanced Documentation Metadata System](concepts/enhanced-documentation-metadata-system.md)** - Rich metadata extraction and management for comprehensive documentation context
- **[Related Pages Discovery System](concepts/related-pages-discovery-system.md)** - Intelligent algorithms for finding and suggesting related documentation content
- **[Test-aware Documentation Generation](concepts/test-aware-documentation-generation.md)** - Documentation that incorporates test cases and usage examples automatically
- **[Test Coverage Discovery and Analysis](concepts/test-coverage-discovery-and-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of test coverage to enhance documentation quality
- **[Two-phase Cross-linking System](concepts/two-phase-cross-linking-system.md)** - Sophisticated linking strategy that builds relationships in multiple passes
- **[Web Dashboard Architecture](concepts/web-dashboard-architecture.md)** - Design and structure of the web-based interface for browsing generated documentation

## Components

Key system components and their implementations:

- **[LinkDiscoveryAgent](components/link-discovery-agent.md)** - Automated discovery and analysis of code relationships and dependencies
- **[Production-ready Server Setup](components/production-ready-server-setup.md)** - Configuration and deployment setup for production environments
- **[Test-driven Code Example Extraction](components/test-driven-code-example-extraction.md)** - Extraction of real usage examples from test suites
- **[WikiManager Integration](components/wiki-manager-integration.md)** - Core management system for wiki generation and maintenance

## Guides

Practical guides for development, testing, and extension:

- **[Development Workflow](guides/development-workflow.md)** - Step-by-step development processes and best practices
- **[Extension Patterns](guides/extension-patterns.md)** - Patterns and approaches for extending the system with new functionality
- **[Getting Started](guides/getting-started.md)** - Complete setup guide from installation to first wiki generation
- **[Testing Approach](guides/testing-approach.md)** - Testing strategies, frameworks, and best practices used in the project
