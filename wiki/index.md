# CodeWiki-Generator

An intelligent documentation generation system that automatically creates comprehensive wikis for code repositories. This tool leverages AI agents to analyze repository structure, extract architectural patterns, and generate organized documentation with navigational aids.

## Concepts

Core architectural patterns and design principles that drive the wiki generation system:

- **[Architecture synthesis agent pattern](concepts/architecture-synthesis-agent-pattern.md)** - Agent-based approach for automatically synthesizing system architecture documentation
- **[Category-based content organization](concepts/category-based-content-organization.md)** - Systematic approach to organizing documentation content into logical categories
- **[JSON response cleaning for LLM APIs](concepts/json-response-cleaning-for-llm-apis.md)** - Techniques for sanitizing and validating JSON responses from language model APIs
- **[Operational documentation generation](concepts/operational-documentation-generation.md)** - Automated creation of operational guides and procedures from code analysis
- **[Operational Guide Generation](concepts/operational-guide-generation.md)** - Systematic approach to generating user-facing operational documentation
- **[Repository fingerprinting](concepts/repository-fingerprinting.md)** - Method for creating unique signatures that capture repository characteristics
- **[Resilient LLM response parsing](concepts/resilient-llm-response-parsing.md)** - Robust strategies for handling and parsing variable language model outputs
- **[System-level documentation generation](concepts/system-level-documentation-generation.md)** - High-level documentation creation for entire system architectures
- **[Wiki index generation system](concepts/wiki-index-generation-system.md)** - Framework for automatically creating navigational index pages
- **[Wiki index generation with auto-navigation](concepts/wiki-index-generation-with-auto-navigation.md)** - Enhanced index generation with automatic navigation structure creation

## Components

Key components and agents that power the documentation generation pipeline:

- **[ArchitectureOverviewAgent](components/architecture-overview-agent.md)** - AI agent responsible for analyzing and documenting system architecture
- **[GuideGenerationAgent](components/guide-generation-agent.md)** - Specialized agent for creating user guides and operational documentation
- **[Progressive JSON repair strategy](components/progressive-json-repair-strategy.md)** - Multi-stage approach for repairing malformed JSON responses
- **[Repository Structure Analysis](components/repository-structure-analysis.md)** - Component for analyzing and mapping repository file structures
- **[Architecture Overview](concepts/architecture.md)** - High-level system architecture documentation

## Navigation

- Browse **Concepts** to understand the theoretical foundations and patterns
- Explore **Components** to learn about specific implementation details
- Start with the [Architecture Overview](concepts/architecture.md) for a system-wide perspective
- Use the repository structure analysis to understand how your codebase will be processed

Each page includes detailed explanations, implementation notes, and cross-references to related concepts and components.
