# Cross-commit Pattern Identification and Trend Analysis

## Purpose and Overview

The MetaAnalysisAgent performs higher-level pattern analysis across multiple commits to identify documentation themes, gaps, and improvement opportunities. It operates as a meta-layer that analyzes the accumulated output from other documentation agents to provide strategic insights about documentation evolution and quality.

## Key Functionality

### Pattern Detection
- **Cross-commit analysis**: Examines documentation patterns spanning multiple commits to identify recurring themes and trends
- **Gap identification**: Detects areas where documentation coverage is insufficient or missing entirely
- **Reorganization suggestions**: Recommends structural improvements based on content analysis

### Intelligent Scheduling
- **Frequency-based triggers**: Uses `shouldRunMetaAnalysis()` to determine optimal timing for analysis based on commit activity
- **Adaptive scheduling**: Adjusts analysis frequency to balance insight value with computational overhead

### Analysis Process
```markdown
analyzeProgress() workflow:
1. Collects accumulated concepts and pages from previous commits
2. Sends structured data to Claude via PromptManager's 'meta-analysis' template  
3. Receives AI-generated insights on themes, gaps, and recommendations
4. Validates and normalizes response using _validateResponse()
5. Returns actionable improvement suggestions
```

### Response Validation
- **Structure enforcement**: Ensures Claude's responses contain required array fields for themes, gaps, and recommendations
- **Data normalization**: Standardizes response format for consistent downstream processing

## Relationships

### Dependencies
- **ClaudeClient**: Powers AI-driven pattern recognition and analysis across commit data
- **PromptManager**: Provides structured 'meta-analysis' template for consistent Claude interactions

### Integration Points
- **Input sources**: Consumes concepts and pages generated by other documentation agents
- **Analysis scope**: Operates on aggregated data rather than individual commits
- **Output usage**: Provides strategic guidance that complements tactical commit-level analysis

### System Position
Functions as the analytical capstone that transforms individual commit insights into broader documentation strategy recommendations, enabling continuous improvement of documentation quality and organization.
