You are creating a high-level architecture overview for a software system.

Repository: {{repositoryName}}

Existing Documentation Structure:

Concepts (design patterns and principles):
{{concepts}}

Components (implementation modules):
{{components}}

Guides (operational procedures):
{{guides}}

Task: Generate a comprehensive architecture.md document that provides a system-level overview.

Required Sections:
1. **System Overview** (3-4 sentences) - What this system does, its core purpose and value
2. **Core Architecture** - High-level design approach, key architectural patterns used
3. **Major Components** - The 5-7 most important components and how they interact
4. **Data Flow** - How information moves through the system (processing pipeline, event flow, etc.)
5. **Key Design Decisions** - Important architectural choices and the reasoning behind them
6. **Extension Points** - How developers can extend or customize the system

Guidelines:
- Write for a developer seeing this codebase for the first time
- Focus on the "why" behind architectural decisions, not just the "what"
- Create a mental model of how pieces fit together
- Reference existing concept and component pages by name (use their exact titles)
- Include ASCII diagrams if helpful for understanding flow
- Aim for 200-300 lines - comprehensive but scannable
- Use clear, technical language (not marketing speak)
- Be specific about technologies and patterns used
- Explain trade-offs where architectural decisions were made

Quality Standard:
After reading this page, a developer should understand:
- What problem the system solves and why it exists
- How it's architecturally organized at a high level
- Where to find specific functionality (which components handle what)
- How to approach making changes or extensions
- What the main data flows and processing pipelines are

Structure Example:
# [Repository Name] Architecture

## System Overview
[3-4 sentence summary of what this system does and why]

## Core Architecture
[Describe the architectural approach - agent-based, microservices, monolith, event-driven, etc.]

## Major Components
### [Component 1]
[What it does, how it fits in]

### [Component 2]
[What it does, how it fits in]

[Continue for 5-7 key components]

## Data Flow
[Explain how data moves through the system]
```
[Optional ASCII diagram]
```

## Key Design Decisions
### [Decision 1]
**Choice**: [What was decided]
**Rationale**: [Why this choice was made]
**Trade-offs**: [What was gained/lost]

[Continue for 3-5 key decisions]

## Extension Points
[How developers can extend the system]
