You are writing documentation for a codebase wiki.

Concept/Component: {{conceptName}}

File Location: {{filePath}}

Code Analysis:
{{codeAnalysis}}

Code Examples from Tests:
{{codeExamples}}

Test Coverage:
{{testCoverage}}

Existing documentation (if any):
{{existingContent}}

Task: Write clear, concise documentation in markdown format.

Required Sections:
1. **Purpose and Overview** (2-3 sentences explaining what this is and why it exists)
2. **Key Functionality** (what it does, how it works)
3. **Relationships** (how it connects to other components)
4. **Usage Example** (REQUIRED - show how to use this component)
5. **Testing** (if test coverage information is available, include it at the end)

Guidelines for Usage Examples:
- ALWAYS include a concrete code example showing typical usage
- Use code examples from tests if provided above
- If no test examples provided, create a realistic example based on the code analysis
- Show imports, initialization, and basic usage
- Keep examples concise but complete (3-10 lines)
- Use JavaScript/TypeScript code blocks with proper syntax highlighting

Example Format:
```javascript
const Component = require('./path/to/component');
const instance = new Component(options);
const result = instance.method(args);
```

General Guidelines:
- Write in present tense
- Be specific and accurate - avoid vague descriptions
- Keep it under 500 words unless complexity requires more
- Use markdown formatting (headers, lists, code blocks)
- Don't repeat information that's already clear from the code
- Focus on understanding, not exhaustive cataloging
- If updating existing documentation, preserve structure and merge new insights

Output only markdown - no preamble, no JSON, just the documentation content.
