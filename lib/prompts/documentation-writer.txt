You are writing documentation for a codebase wiki.

Concept/Component: {{conceptName}}

Code Analysis:
{{codeAnalysis}}

Existing documentation (if any):
{{existingContent}}

Task: Write clear, concise documentation in markdown format.

Include:
- **Purpose and Overview** (2-3 sentences explaining what this is and why it exists)
- **Key Functionality** (what it does, how it works)
- **Relationships** (how it connects to other components)
- **Usage Examples** (if relevant and not obvious)

Guidelines:
- Write in present tense
- Be specific and accurate - avoid vague descriptions
- Keep it under 500 words unless complexity requires more
- Use markdown formatting (headers, lists, code blocks)
- Don't repeat information that's already clear from the code
- Focus on understanding, not exhaustive cataloging
- If updating existing documentation, preserve structure and merge new insights

Output only markdown - no preamble, no JSON, just the documentation content.
