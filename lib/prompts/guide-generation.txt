You are generating operational guides for a code repository's documentation.

Repository: {{repositoryName}}

Repository Information:
{{repositoryInfo}}

Existing Wiki Structure:
{{wikiStructure}}

Task: Generate practical guides that help developers work with this codebase.

CRITICAL PRIORITY GUIDES (generate if ANY evidence exists):
1. **Getting Started** - ALWAYS generate if repository has:
   - package.json with npm scripts
   - README.md or setup instructions
   - Any runnable entry points (main files, executables)
   - Test files (developers need to know how to run them)
   This is the MOST IMPORTANT guide for developers new to the codebase.

Consider the following guide types:
1. **Getting Started** - Installation, setup, first run (if repository has clear entry points)
2. **Testing Approach** - How to run tests, testing patterns used (if tests exist)
3. **Development Workflow** - How to develop, build, deploy (if applicable)
4. **Extension Patterns** - How to add new features following established patterns (if clear patterns exist)
5. **Configuration** - How to configure the system (if configuration exists)
6. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions (if error handling patterns exist)

Guide Prioritization (create in this order):
1. Getting Started (CRITICAL - always attempt if repository is runnable)
2. Testing Approach (if tests exist - very important for contributors)
3. Development Workflow (if clear dev process exists)
4. Extension Patterns (if design patterns are evident)
5. Configuration (if config options exist)
6. Troubleshooting (if error handling patterns exist)

Target: Maximum 4 guides, but MUST include Getting Started if repository is runnable.

Return JSON only with the following structure:
{
  "guides": [
    {
      "title": "Guide Title",
      "content": "Full markdown content for the guide including:\n- Clear introduction\n- Step-by-step instructions\n- Code examples where helpful\n- Links to relevant components or concepts"
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Only create guides that would genuinely help developers
- Each guide should be actionable (specific steps, not vague advice)
- Include concrete examples from the actual codebase
- Reference existing components and concepts by name
- Keep guides focused (one guide per topic)
- Aim for 2-4 guides maximum - quality over quantity
- Skip guides if the repository structure doesn't support them

Guide Quality Standards:
- Introduction: Why this guide exists and who it's for
- Prerequisites: What you need before starting
- Steps: Clear, numbered or bulleted instructions
- Examples: Real code snippets or commands
- Next Steps: What to do after completing the guide

DO NOT create guides for topics where you don't have enough information.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY valid JSON
- DO NOT include any explanatory text before or after the JSON
- DO NOT wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
- DO NOT include any commentary or notes
- Start your response with { and end with }
- If you cannot generate any guides, return: {"guides": []}
