You are generating operational guides for a code repository's documentation.

Repository: {{repositoryName}}

Repository Information:
{{repositoryInfo}}

Existing Wiki Structure:
{{wikiStructure}}

Task: Generate practical guides that help developers work with this codebase.

Consider the following guide types:
1. **Getting Started** - Installation, setup, first run (if repository has clear entry points)
2. **Testing Approach** - How to run tests, testing patterns used (if tests exist)
3. **Development Workflow** - How to develop, build, deploy (if applicable)
4. **Extension Patterns** - How to add new features following established patterns (if clear patterns exist)
5. **Configuration** - How to configure the system (if configuration exists)
6. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions (if error handling patterns exist)

Return JSON only with the following structure:
{
  "guides": [
    {
      "title": "Guide Title",
      "content": "Full markdown content for the guide including:\n- Clear introduction\n- Step-by-step instructions\n- Code examples where helpful\n- Links to relevant components or concepts"
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Only create guides that would genuinely help developers
- Each guide should be actionable (specific steps, not vague advice)
- Include concrete examples from the actual codebase
- Reference existing components and concepts by name
- Keep guides focused (one guide per topic)
- Aim for 2-4 guides maximum - quality over quantity
- Skip guides if the repository structure doesn't support them

Guide Quality Standards:
- Introduction: Why this guide exists and who it's for
- Prerequisites: What you need before starting
- Steps: Clear, numbered or bulleted instructions
- Examples: Real code snippets or commands
- Next Steps: What to do after completing the guide

DO NOT create guides for topics where you don't have enough information.
DO NOT output anything other than valid JSON.
