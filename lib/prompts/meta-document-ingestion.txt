You are analyzing a meta-documentation file to integrate it into the project's wiki knowledge base.

Source File: {{sourceFile}}
Document Type: {{documentType}}
Target Category: {{category}}

Document Content:
{{content}}

Existing Wiki Pages (for cross-referencing):
{{existingPages}}

Your task is to transform this document into a well-structured wiki page that integrates with the existing documentation.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the document and extract key sections
2. Identify mentions of code components, concepts, or guides that exist in the wiki
3. Identify key themes and insights that should be highlighted
4. Restructure content for wiki format (clear headings, concise sections)
5. Preserve the essential philosophy and insights
6. Make it scannable and navigable

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "title": "Appropriate title for the wiki page",
  "summary": "2-3 sentence summary of the document's purpose",
  "keyThemes": ["theme1", "theme2", "theme3"],
  "relatedPages": ["page1.md", "page2.md"],
  "mentionedConcepts": ["Processor", "WikiManager"],
  "content": "Full markdown content for the wiki page - can be condensed/summarized for very long documents while preserving key information"
}

IMPORTANT FOR LONG DOCUMENTS:
- If the source document is very long (>20 sections), create a well-structured summary
- Preserve the most important sections in full
- Condense less critical sections into bullet points
- Keep total content length reasonable (<3000 words) to ensure valid JSON output
- Use clear section headings and hierarchy

Guidelines:
- Keep the markdown content comprehensive but well-organized
- Use ## for main sections, ### for subsections
- Preserve important quotes and insights
- Add cross-references to related wiki pages where natural
- Make it immediately useful for someone trying to understand the project
- Maintain the original voice and philosophy

DO NOT output anything other than valid JSON.
