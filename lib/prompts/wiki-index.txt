You are generating a wiki index page that serves as the navigation hub.

Repository: {{repositoryName}}

Wiki Structure:
{{wikiStructure}}

Task: Generate a comprehensive index.md file in markdown format.

Requirements:
1. Start with a clear title and overview
2. Organize pages by category (Concepts, Components, Guides)
3. For each page, include:
   - Link to the page
   - Brief description (1 line) based on the title
4. Add a "Getting Started" or "Navigation" section
5. Keep it concise and scannable
6. Use proper markdown formatting

Structure:
- Title and project overview (2-3 sentences)
- Section for each category with brief intro
- Bulleted list of pages with links and descriptions
- Navigation tips at the end

DO NOT include frontmatter (---). Start directly with the markdown heading.

Generate ONLY the markdown content for the index page, nothing else.
